{"edinet_code": "E00252", "doc_id": "S100LM77", "label": 0, "prob": 0.7, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report contains several potential red flags that could indicate fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation. Firstly, the significant drop in '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Operating Cash Flow) from a positive 1.96 billion yen in the prior year to a negative 5.23 billion yen in the current year is concerning, especially when paired with an increase in revenue and profit. This discrepancy between reported profits and cash flow could suggest aggressive revenue recognition or manipulation of working capital accounts. Secondly, the '投資有価証券売却益' (Gain on Sale of Investment Securities) in the prior year was extraordinarily high at 3.92 billion yen, which significantly inflated the prior year's profits. The absence of such gains in the current year could explain the sharp decline in net income, but it also raises questions about the sustainability and quality of earnings. Thirdly, the '現金及び現金同等物の残高' (Cash and Cash Equivalents) has dropped dramatically from 8.54 billion yen to 2.99 billion yen, which is inconsistent with the company's reported profitability. Lastly, the '未払法人税等' (Unpaid Corporate Taxes) has decreased significantly from 1.89 billion yen to 645 million yen, which could indicate potential underpayment or deferral of taxes. While these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight inconsistencies and unusual patterns that require further scrutiny."}

However, there are a few non-numerical inconsistencies and potential red flags that warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **Average Temporary Employees (平均臨時雇用人員)**: The sharp drop in the average number of temporary employees from 356 (Prior2Year) to 25 (Prior1Year) and then to 16 (CurrentYear) is unusual. This could indicate a reporting error, a significant change in employment practices, or an attempt to manipulate labor cost reporting.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Special Items**: The significant increase in '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) from 247 million yen (Prior1Year) to 2,576 million yen (CurrentYear) is notable. While this could be legitimate, the reasons for such a large increase should be clearly explained in the report. The lack of detailed breakdowns for these losses raises questions.\n\n3. **Potentially Inconsistent Cash Flow Data**: The cash flow from operating activities (営業キャッシュフロー) shows a significant increase from 16,188 million yen (Prior1Year) to 22,833 million yen (CurrentYear). While this is not inherently suspicious, it is worth investigating whether this increase aligns with the company's operational performance and other financial metrics.\n\n4. **Lack of Diluted Earnings Per Share (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益)**: The absence of diluted earnings per share data across all years ('－') is unusual for a company of this size. This could indicate a lack of transparency or an attempt to obscure the impact of potential stock dilution.\n\n5. **Unusual Trends in Deferred Tax Assets (繰延税金資産)**: The deferred tax assets increased significantly from 2,355 million yen (Prior1Year) to 2,844 million yen (CurrentYear). While this could be legitimate, it is worth verifying whether this aligns with the company's tax strategy and profitability.\n\n6. **Sharp Increase in Investment Securities (投資有価証券)**: The value of investment securities increased significantly from 13,482 million yen (Prior1Year) to 18,033 million yen (CurrentYear). This could indicate a shift in investment strategy, but the rationale for such a large increase should be clearly explained.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further scrutiny.

The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted EPS) is consistently missing ('－') across all years. While this could be due to the company not having any dilutive securities, it is unusual for a company of this size and warrants clarification.\n\n2. The '自己株式' (Treasury Stock) shows a significant increase in the current year (-1,053,000,000 to -9,810,000,000). This suggests a large buyback of shares, which could be a legitimate strategy but might also be used to manipulate EPS or other financial metrics. The rationale for this buyback should be examined.\n\n3. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a sharp increase in outflows in the current year (-11,608,000,000 to -28,934,000,000). This could indicate significant investments, but the nature of these investments should be reviewed to ensure they are legitimate and align with the company's strategy.\n\n4. The '退職給付に係る資産' (Retirement Benefit Assets) appears for the first time in the current year (2,702,000,000). This is not necessarily fraudulent but should be clarified, as it represents a new line item.\n\n5. The '特別利益合計' (Extraordinary Income) has increased significantly in the current year (90,000,000 to 2,158,000,000). This could be due to one-time gains, such as asset sales, but the details should be verified to ensure they are not being used to inflate profits artificially.\n\n6. The '投資有価証券評価損' (Loss on Valuation of Investment Securities) has also increased significantly (38,000,000 to 978,000,000). This could indicate a decline in the value of investments, which should be investigated further to understand the underlying reasons.\n\n7. The '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) has more than doubled in the current year (23,931,000,000 to 46,732,000,000). While this is a positive development, the reasons for such a significant increase should be examined to ensure they are sustainable and not due to one-time factors.\n\n8. The '短期借入金の純増減額' (Net Increase/Decrease in Short-Term Borrowings) shows a smaller outflow in the current year (-700,000,000 to -128,000,000).

This could indicate issues with working capital management or potential manipulation of cash flow figures.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Working Capital Accounts**: The cash flow statement shows significant changes in working capital accounts, such as a large increase in accounts receivable (-4.10 billion yen) and a large decrease in accounts payable (-6.56 billion yen). These changes are not fully explained by the decline in revenue and could suggest aggressive revenue recognition or delayed payment to suppliers.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by 8.18 billion yen, which is inconsistent with the relatively small net cash outflow from financing activities (-1.44 billion yen) and the reported cash inflow from investing activities (-6.91 billion yen). This discrepancy could indicate potential misclassification or errors in cash flow reporting.\n\n4. **Unexplained Increase in Intangible Assets**: The balance sheet shows a significant increase in intangible assets from 3.58 billion yen to 8.45 billion yen. This increase is not explained in the report and could indicate potential overstatement of intangible assets.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Foreign Exchange Adjustments**: The foreign exchange adjustment account (為替換算調整勘定) has shifted from a positive 372 million yen to a negative 237 million yen. While this could be due to currency fluctuations, the magnitude of the change should be investigated further.\n\n6. **Lack of Disclosure on Diluted EPS**: The report consistently shows '－' for diluted EPS (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益), which could indicate a lack of transparency or potential issues with stock-based compensation or convertible securities.\n\nWhile these issues do not definitively indicate fraud, they raise questions about the company's financial reporting practices and warrant further investigation."}

This is unusual and warrants further investigation into the sources of this increase.\n\n2. **Significant Gain from Sale of Investment Securities**: The '投資有価証券売却益' (Gain on Sale of Investment Securities) increased dramatically from 20 million yen in the prior year to 4.08 billion yen in the current year. This one-time gain appears to have significantly boosted net income, which could be a strategy to mask declining operational performance.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) turned positive in the current year (2.24 billion yen) after being consistently negative in prior years. This is primarily due to the sale of investment securities, which aligns with the significant gain mentioned above. This could indicate a potential liquidation of assets to improve financial metrics.\n\n4. **Decline in Operating Cash Flow**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) declined significantly from 8.4 billion yen in the prior year to 6.04 billion yen in the current year, which is inconsistent with the sharp increase in net income. This discrepancy between cash flow and net income could be a red flag.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Retirement Benefit Liabilities**: The '退職給付に係る負債' (Retirement Benefit Liabilities) decreased significantly from 9.51 billion yen in the prior year to 2.71 billion yen in the current year. This sharp reduction could indicate changes in accounting assumptions or methods, which should be scrutinized.\n\n6. **Significant Increase in Unrealized Gains on Securities**: The 'その他有価証券評価差額金' (Unrealized Gains on Available-for-Sale Securities) more than doubled from 5.36 billion yen in the prior year to 11.3 billion yen in the current year. This could indicate a reliance on market fluctuations to improve the balance sheet.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Trends in Comprehensive Income**: The '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income) shows a highly volatile trend, with significant losses in prior years followed by a sharp increase to 18.54 billion yen in the current year. This volatility could indicate aggressive accounting practices.\n\n8. **Unusual Changes in Deferred Hedge Gains/Losses**: The '繰延ヘッジ損益' (Deferred Hedge Gains/Losses) shifted from a loss of 322 million yen in the prior year to a gain of 351 million yen in the current year. This change should be investigated to ensure it is not being used to manipulate earnings.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, these non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest the possibility of aggressive accounting practices or potential fraud.

However, there are several non-numerical and logical red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Revenue Decline vs. Profitability**: The company's revenue ('売上高') has significantly declined in the current year compared to the prior year (from 113.4 billion yen to 98.9 billion yen, a drop of approximately 12.8%). Despite this, the company maintains a relatively high level of profitability ('経常利益' and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'). While this is not impossible, it raises questions about cost management or potential accounting adjustments to maintain profitability.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has decreased significantly from the prior year (7.7 billion yen to 3.1 billion yen). This is inconsistent with the reported profitability, as one would expect higher profits to translate into stronger operating cash flows. Additionally, the large increase in '売上債権の増減額' (accounts receivable) suggests that a significant portion of revenue may not have been collected, which could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices.\n\n3. **Unusual Special Gains and Losses**: The current year includes a significant increase in '特別利益合計' (special gains) from 0.5 million yen to 90.8 million yen, as well as the appearance of '減損損失' (impairment losses) of 54.6 million yen, which were absent in the prior year. These adjustments could be used to manipulate net income.\n\n4. **Decline in Temporary Employees**: The average number of temporary employees ('平均臨時雇用人員') has been steadily declining over the years, from 613 four years ago to 451 in the current year. This could indicate cost-cutting measures, but it may also suggest understaffing, which could impact operations and future performance.\n\n5. **Unchanged Financial Activities**: The financial cash flow ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') remains unchanged at -57.5 million yen, which is unusual given the significant changes in other financial metrics. This could indicate a lack of transparency in financial activities.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: Several key metrics, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) and '株価収益率' (P/E ratio), are missing ('－'). While this may be due to legitimate reasons, the absence of these figures limits the ability to fully assess the company's financial health and could be a red flag if intentionally omitted.\n\nWhile these issues do not definitively prove fraud, they warrant further investigation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}

The '建設仮勘定' (Construction in Progress) shows a significant increase from 14 million yen in the prior year to 857 million yen in the current year. This is a large jump and warrants further investigation to ensure the legitimacy of the reported construction projects. \n3. The '法人税等調整額' (Income Tax Adjustment) shows a significant swing from 109 million yen in the prior year to -28 million yen in the current year. While this could be due to legitimate tax adjustments, such a large change should be explained in the notes to the financial statements. \n4. The '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) increased dramatically from 195 million yen in the prior year to 2,141 million yen in the current year. This is a significant improvement and should be supported by clear explanations, especially since the company's net income has remained relatively stable. \n5. The '従業員数' (Number of Employees) and '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) have been decreasing consistently over the years. While this could be due to operational efficiency, it is worth investigating whether this aligns with the company's reported growth in assets and cash flow. \n6. The '減価償却費及び償却費' (Depreciation and Amortization) decreased from 549 million yen in the prior year to 470 million yen in the current year, despite an increase in fixed assets.

This could indicate issues with cash collection or higher operating expenses, which should be investigated further.\n\n2. **Increase in Long-term Borrowings**: The company has significantly increased its long-term borrowings (from 3.5 billion yen to 20.6 billion yen), which could indicate liquidity issues or aggressive expansion. This should be cross-verified with the company's stated strategy or capital expenditure plans.\n\n3. **Inventory Build-up**: There is a notable increase in '仕掛品' (work-in-progress inventory) from 2.05 billion yen to 9.53 billion yen. This could indicate production inefficiencies, overproduction, or potential issues with demand forecasting.\n\n4. **Special Gains and Losses**: The company has reported a significant increase in both special gains (特別利益) and special losses (特別損失). While this is not inherently fraudulent, the nature of these items (e.g., fixed asset sales, investment securities gains/losses) should be reviewed to ensure they are not being used to manipulate earnings.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Accounts Payable and Receivable**: There is a significant increase in accounts receivable (売上債権) and a decrease in accounts payable (仕入債務). This could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or changes in payment terms with suppliers, which should be investigated further.\n\n6. **Consistency in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance is consistent across the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and summary data, which is a positive sign.

This is not accompanied by a proportional increase in revenue or profitability, which could indicate potential misreporting of employee numbers or other operational inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Negative Non-Controlling Interest**: The '非支配株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net income attributable to non-controlling interests) is reported as negative (-117,000,000) in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it is unusual and warrants further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.\n\n3. **Significant Changes in Cash Flow Components**: The cash flow from investing activities ('投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a drastic outflow of -20,560,000,000 in the current year compared to -8,090,000,000 in the prior year. This significant increase in outflows is not clearly explained in the report and could indicate potential mismanagement or misreporting of investments.\n\n4. **Unusual Gains from Negative Goodwill**: The report includes a '負ののれん発生益' (gain from negative goodwill) of 494,000,000 in the current year, which is not present in prior years. Negative goodwill is uncommon and could indicate that the company acquired assets at a price significantly below their fair value, which may require further scrutiny.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Trends in Profitability Metrics**: While revenue ('売上高') increased significantly (14.4% year-over-year), operating profit ('営業利益') and ordinary profit ('経常利益') decreased. This inconsistency could indicate issues with cost management or potential misclassification of expenses.\n\n6. **Significant Decrease in Financial Cash Flow**: The financial cash flow ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shifted from a positive 12,412,000,000 in the prior year to a negative -9,445,000,000 in the current year. This drastic change is not accompanied by a clear explanation and could indicate potential issues with debt management or dividend payments.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: The deferred tax assets ('繰延税金資産') decreased significantly, while deferred tax liabilities ('繰延税金負債') increased.

This is a significant reduction without any clear explanation in the report. Such a drop could indicate operational downsizing, but it is not reflected in a proportional reduction in sales or costs, which raises questions.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Concerns**: The operating cash flow has decreased significantly from 'Prior1Year' (38,533,000,000) to 'CurrentYear' (27,199,000,000), despite an increase in sales revenue. This could indicate inefficiencies or potential mismanagement of working capital. Additionally, the cash flow from investing activities shows a consistent negative trend, but the reduction in capital expenditures ('投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') in the 'CurrentYear' is not clearly explained.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: The '退職給付に係る資産' (retirement benefit assets) increased significantly from 'Prior1Year' (11,128,000,000) to 'CurrentYear' (18,656,000,000).

However, this increase is not reflected in a proportional improvement in profitability metrics such as '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益,' which remains negative and has worsened. This discrepancy raises questions about the quality of the revenue growth. Secondly, the cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a massive inflow of 261 million yen in the current year, which is significantly higher than prior years. This could indicate heavy reliance on external financing, which might not be sustainable. Thirdly, the balance sheet shows a significant increase in '現金及び現金同等物' (cash and cash equivalents) from 11 million yen to 385 million yen, which is unusual given the company's negative profitability. This could suggest potential window-dressing or misrepresentation of cash balances. Fourthly, the company's '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) has declined significantly over the years, indicating increasing financial leverage and risk.

However, this sharp increase is not accompanied by a corresponding improvement in profitability. In fact, the company reported a significant loss in 'CurrentYear' ('経常利益' and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'). This discrepancy between revenue growth and profitability is unusual and could indicate revenue manipulation.\n\n2. **Deteriorating Profit Margins**: Despite the revenue growth, the company's operating profit ('営業利益') turned negative in 'CurrentYear', and the net loss ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') widened significantly. This could suggest that the revenue growth is not sustainable or that costs are being understated in prior years and overstated in the current year.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') turned negative in 'CurrentYear' despite the significant revenue growth. This is inconsistent with the reported revenue increase and raises questions about the quality of earnings.\n\n4. **Significant Changes in Employee Numbers**: The '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) increased dramatically from 8 in 'Prior1Year' to 79 in 'CurrentYear'.

This could indicate financial distress or an attempt to mask liquidity issues.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Asset and Liability Trends**: The company's total assets ('総資産額') decreased slightly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear', but the liabilities ('負債') remained relatively stable. This has led to a decline in net assets ('純資産額') and a worsening equity ratio ('自己資本比率'). This trend is concerning and could indicate financial instability.\n\n7. **Unusual Accounting Entries**: The report includes a significant impairment loss ('減損損失') in 'Prior1Year' but none in 'CurrentYear', despite the company's worsening financial performance.

However, there are a few potential red flags that could suggest the need for further scrutiny: \n1. The company's revenue ('売上高') has been declining consistently over the past five years, which could indicate operational challenges. Despite this, the company has managed to report increasing profits ('経常利益' and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') in the last two years. This could be due to cost-cutting measures or other factors, but the discrepancy between declining revenue and increasing profits warrants further investigation.\n2. The significant increase in '繰延税金資産' (deferred tax assets) from 3,219,000 yen in the prior year to 89,706,000 yen in the current year is unusual and should be examined. This could indicate aggressive tax planning or adjustments that may not be sustainable.\n3. The '減損損失' (impairment loss) of 87,367,000 yen reported in the current year is a new item that was not present in the prior year. While this could be legitimate, it is worth investigating the nature of the impairment and whether it aligns with the company's overall financial performance.\n4. The company's '従業員数' (number of employees) has been decreasing steadily over the past five years, which could be a sign of downsizing. However, the '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) has increased slightly in the current year, which might indicate a shift in employment practices. This could be a cost-saving measure, but it may also mask underlying operational issues.\n5. The '法人税等調整額' (adjustment for corporate taxes) shows a significant negative value of -113,853,000 yen in the current year, compared to -8,560,000 yen in the prior year. This large adjustment could indicate aggressive tax strategies or one-time adjustments that should be reviewed.\n6. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a significant outflow of -806,623,000 yen in the current year, which is much higher than the prior year's outflow of -249,016,000 yen. This could indicate heavy investment or potential mismanagement of funds.\n7. The '長期借入れによる収入' (proceeds from long-term borrowings) of 500,000,000 yen in the current year is a new item that was not present in the prior year. This could indicate increased reliance on debt, which may impact the company's financial stability.\n8. The '自己株式の取得による支出' (expenditure for acquiring treasury stock) has decreased slightly, but the '配当金の支払額' (dividend payments) has increased significantly from -27,437,000 yen in the prior year to -45,553,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate an attempt to maintain shareholder confidence despite operational challenges.\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **Significant Decline in Revenue**: The company's revenue ('売上高') has dropped significantly from the prior year (from 18.67 billion yen to 14.75 billion yen, a 21% decrease). While this could be due to market conditions, the report does not provide any explanation for this sharp decline, which is unusual for a securities report.\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Anomaly**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has turned negative (-68 million yen) despite the company reporting a net profit ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') of 184 million yen. This discrepancy between profitability and cash flow could indicate issues with revenue recognition or aggressive accounting practices.\n\n3. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company has a significant positive cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') of 928 million yen, primarily driven by an increase in long-term borrowings ('長期借入れによる収入'). This could indicate that the company is relying heavily on debt to sustain operations, which might mask underlying financial difficulties.\n\n4. **Decline in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has decreased consistently over the years, with a notable drop from 472 to 449 in the current year. While this could be due to restructuring, it might also indicate operational challenges or cost-cutting measures that are not explicitly disclosed.\n\n5. **Unexplained Changes in Key Accounts**: There are significant changes in certain balance sheet accounts, such as a sharp increase in '現金及び預金' (cash and deposits) and a decrease in '投資有価証券' (investment securities). These changes are not accompanied by adequate explanations, which raises questions about the company's financial strategy.\n\n6. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The company reported a large gain from the sale of investment securities ('投資有価証券売却益') of 171 million yen, which significantly boosted its special income ('特別利益合計'). This could be a one-time event used to offset operational weaknesses.\n\n7. **Negative Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income ('包括利益') is negative (-171 million yen) despite the company reporting a net profit. This suggests that other components of equity, such as unrealized losses on securities, are deteriorating.\n\n8. **Environmental Provisions**: The '環境対策引当金' (environmental provisions) has been removed in the current year, which could indicate a change in accounting policy or an attempt to reduce liabilities artificially.\n\nWhile none of these issues individually confirm fraudulent activity, the combination of these red flags suggests that the company's financial health and reporting practices warrant closer scrutiny."}

However, there are a few points worth noting that could indicate potential red flags: \n\n1. The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) is consistently missing ('－') across all years. While this could be due to the company not having any dilutive securities, it is unusual for a company of this size and warrants further clarification.\n\n2. The '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) is reported as '－' in the prior year but suddenly appears as 122 million yen in the current year. This could indicate a change in accounting policy or recognition of previously unreported losses, which should be explained in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n3. The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) has decreased significantly from 4.47 billion yen in the prior year to 3.70 billion yen in the current year, despite an increase in revenue. This discrepancy could indicate issues with cash collection or increased operating expenses that are not fully reflected in the income statement.\n\n4. The '棚卸資産の増減額' (Change in Inventory) shows a significant positive adjustment of 390 million yen in the current year compared to a negative adjustment of 1.99 billion yen in the prior year. This could suggest aggressive inventory management or potential manipulation to improve cash flow.\n\n5. The '短期借入金の純増減額' (Net Change in Short-Term Borrowings) shows a significant decrease of 1.05 billion yen in the current year compared to an increase of 464 million yen in the prior year. This could indicate liquidity management issues or a shift in financing strategy.\n\n6. The '投資有価証券' (Investment Securities) increased significantly from 7.39 billion yen in the prior year to 9.61 billion yen in the current year. This could indicate a shift in investment strategy, but the rationale for such a large increase should be clarified.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation or explanation.

This discrepancy could suggest reliance on non-operating income or one-time gains to inflate net income.\n\n3. **Significant Increase in Non-Operating Income (営業外収益)**: The '営業外収益' (Non-Operating Income) increased dramatically from 288,895,000 in the Prior1Year to 1,416,405,000 in the CurrentYear. This is primarily driven by '受取利息' (Interest Income) and '受取配当金' (Dividend Income), which raises questions about the sustainability of earnings.\n\n4. **Large Adjustments in Deferred Tax Assets (繰延税金資産)**: The '繰延税金資産' (Deferred Tax Assets) increased significantly from 142,251,000 in the Prior1Year to 376,038,000 in the CurrentYear. This could indicate aggressive tax planning or potential overstatement of deferred tax assets.\n\n5. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The company reported a significant positive cash flow from financing activities (1861 million yen) in the CurrentYear, despite a large repayment of long-term borrowings (-3799 million yen). This could indicate reliance on new borrowings or other financing activities to maintain liquidity.\n\n6. **Decline in Employee Count**: The number of employees has been steadily declining from 204 in the Prior3Year to 182 in the CurrentYear, which could indicate operational challenges or cost-cutting measures that are not clearly reflected in the financials.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Allowances**: The '貸倒引当金' (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) shows a significant increase in the CurrentYear (-49,358,000) compared to no reported value in the Prior1Year. This could indicate potential issues with receivables or aggressive provisioning.\n\n8. **Negative Tax Expense**: The '法人所得税費用' (Income Tax Expense) is reported as negative (-42,575,000) in the CurrentYear, which is unusual and could indicate aggressive tax strategies or adjustments.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they suggest the need for further investigation into the company's financial practices, particularly around non-operating income, tax adjustments, and cash flow management."}

While this could be due to strong operating cash flows, the increase in cash is not fully explained by the cash flow statement, as the operating cash flow increase (20,222 million yen) is partially offset by negative investment and financing cash flows. This warrants further scrutiny to ensure the cash increase is legitimate.\n\n2. **Significant Decrease in Bonus Provisions**: The bonus provisions have decreased sharply from 1,648 million yen to 889 million yen. This is unusual given the increase in revenue and profits, which would typically lead to higher bonuses. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate expenses to inflate profits.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Inventory**: The inventory levels (including raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods) have increased significantly, while the cost of goods sold has also increased. This could be a sign of overproduction or inventory manipulation to inflate assets.\n\n4. **Omission of Diluted EPS**: The report does not provide diluted earnings per share (EPS) data, marked as '－' for all years. While this may be due to the absence of convertible securities or stock options, it is unusual for a company of this size and profitability to not have any potential dilutive securities. This omission should be clarified.\n\n5. **Unusual Decrease in Long-Term Borrowings**: Long-term borrowings have decreased significantly, from 2,751 million yen to 1,645 million yen, despite the company not showing significant repayment capacity beyond its operating cash flow. This could indicate potential misclassification or undisclosed liabilities.\n\n6. **Significant Increase in Other Comprehensive Income**: The increase in other comprehensive income (OCI) from -56 million yen to 1,534 million yen is notable. This is primarily driven by changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains on securities. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it should be verified to ensure proper accounting treatment.\n\n7. **Consistency in Auditor Verification**: The report has been verified by a certified public accountant, which adds credibility. However, the presence of unusual trends and omissions (e.g., diluted EPS) suggests that further independent verification may be prudent.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to rule out potential manipulation or misrepresentation."}

The significant fluctuation in '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income), which dropped drastically from a positive value in Prior2Year to a large negative value in Prior1Year, and then rebounded to a positive value in the CurrentYear. While this could be due to external factors, such as market conditions or currency exchange rates, it is worth investigating the reasons behind such volatility. \n2. The '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) shows a dramatic decrease from Prior1Year to the CurrentYear. This could indicate aggressive write-offs in the previous year or a change in accounting policies. \n3. The '自己株式' (Treasury Stock) shows a significant reduction in the CurrentYear, which could indicate a large buyback program. While not inherently fraudulent, it is worth verifying whether this aligns with the company's stated strategy and financial health. \n4. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a consistent negative trend, which is typical for companies investing in growth. However, the large negative value in Prior2Year followed by a significant improvement in Prior1Year and CurrentYear should be examined to ensure there are no irregularities in asset acquisitions or disposals. \n5. The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) shows a significant outflow in the CurrentYear, which could be related to debt repayments or other financing activities. This should be cross-checked with the company's debt and equity changes to ensure consistency. \n6. The '法人税等調整額' (Income Tax Adjustment) shows a significant increase in the CurrentYear compared to Prior1Year, which could indicate changes in tax strategies or adjustments. This should be reviewed for compliance with tax regulations. \nOverall, while there are some areas that warrant further investigation, there is no definitive evidence of fraudulent activity based on the provided data."}

This is unusual given that other profitability metrics, such as operating profit (営業利益) and ordinary profit (経常利益), have increased. A negative comprehensive income could indicate significant unrealized losses, possibly from investments or foreign exchange adjustments, but the report does not provide sufficient detail to explain this discrepancy.\n\n2. **Cash Flow from Financing Activities (財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー)**: The cash flow from financing activities has swung dramatically from a positive 77,380,000,000 in the prior year to a negative 89,762,000,000 in the current year. This is a significant change and could indicate aggressive debt repayment or other financial restructuring. However, the report does not provide a clear explanation for this shift.\n\n3. **Significant Impairment Loss (減損損失)**: The impairment loss for the current year is 61,569,000,000, a massive increase compared to the prior year's 191,000,000. This suggests that the company has written down the value of its assets significantly, which could indicate poor asset management or an attempt to manipulate earnings by recognizing losses in a single period.\n\n4. **Decline in Fixed Assets (固定資産)**: The value of fixed assets has decreased significantly from 1,555,699,000,000 in the prior year to 1,350,887,000,000 in the current year. This aligns with the large impairment loss but raises questions about the company's asset valuation practices.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Short-Term Borrowings (短期借入金)**: Short-term borrowings have decreased significantly from 319,720,000,000 in the prior year to 178,157,000,000 in the current year. This could indicate a shift in the company's financing strategy, but the lack of explanation is concerning.\n\n6. **Foreign Exchange Adjustments (為替換算調整勘定)**: The foreign exchange adjustment account has decreased significantly from 76,457,000,000 in the prior year to 41,369,000,000 in the current year. This could be related to currency fluctuations, but the report does not provide sufficient detail to confirm this.\n\n7. **Unexplained Decline in Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益)**: Net income attributable to parent company shareholders has decreased from 17,344,000,000 in the prior year to 15,257,000,000 in the current year, despite an increase in operating profit and ordinary profit. This discrepancy is not adequately explained in the report.\n\n8. **Significant Decrease in Investment Securities (投資有価証券)**: The value of investment securities has decreased significantly from 203,675,000,000 in the prior year to 149,094,000,000 in the current year. This could indicate asset sales or write-downs, but the report does not provide sufficient detail.\n\nWhile these issues do not definitively indicate fraud, they raise questions about the company's financial practices and transparency.

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Unusual Increase in Net Income and Comprehensive Income**: The '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) and '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income) show a dramatic increase in the current year compared to prior years. This is inconsistent with the significant decline in '売上高' (Revenue) and '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit), which turned negative. Such a discrepancy could indicate manipulation of non-operating or extraordinary items to inflate profits.\n\n2. **Negative Operating Profit with High Extraordinary Gains**: The company reported a significant operating loss ('営業利益') of -1,354,427,000 yen, yet it achieved a high net income due to extraordinary gains, particularly from '負ののれん発生益' (Negative Goodwill Gain) of 2,420,250,000 yen. Negative goodwill gains are non-recurring and can be used to artificially boost profits. The reliance on such gains raises concerns about the sustainability of the reported profits.\n\n3. **Significant Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The '現金及び現金同等物の残高' (Cash and Cash Equivalents) more than doubled in the current year, increasing from 5,379,806,000 yen to 10,651,319,000 yen. This is unusual given the negative operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') of only 279,178,000 yen. The increase appears to be driven by '連結の範囲の変更を伴う子会社株式の取得による収入' (Proceeds from Acquisition of Subsidiary Shares due to Change in Consolidation Scope) of 2,935,110,000 yen, which is a one-time event. Such a large increase in cash without corresponding operational performance could be a red flag.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Equity**: The '資本金' (Capital Stock) and '資本剰余金' (Capital Surplus) more than doubled in the current year. This could be due to a capital injection or other equity transactions, but the report does not provide sufficient details to verify the legitimacy of these changes. Sudden and significant changes in equity accounts can sometimes be used to mask financial issues.\n\n5. **Discrepancy in Asset Growth and Revenue Decline**: The '総資産額' (Total Assets) increased significantly from 27,368,038,000 yen to 40,396,840,000 yen, while revenue ('売上高') declined from 14,143,071,000 yen to 11,927,587,000 yen. This mismatch between asset growth and revenue decline is unusual and could indicate potential overstatement of assets or underreporting of liabilities.\n\n6. **High Stock Price-to-Earnings Ratio in Prior Years**: The '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) was extremely high (1,140.0) two years ago, which is unusual and could indicate market overvaluation or manipulation of earnings in prior periods.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') decreased steadily over the years but increased slightly in the current year. This is inconsistent with the declining revenue and could indicate potential misreporting of employee data.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, the logical inconsistencies and unusual trends highlighted above suggest a moderate probability of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices."}

This is a significant change and could indicate unusual financing activities, such as aggressive borrowing or other financial maneuvers, which may not be sustainable or could be masking underlying issues.\n\n2. **Decline in Profitability Metrics**: The '１株当たり当期純利益' (Earnings Per Share) and '自己資本利益率' (Return on Equity) have both declined significantly in the current year. For example, EPS dropped from 34.22 JPY to 17.55 JPY, and ROE dropped from 0.063 to 0.028. This decline in profitability is inconsistent with the increase in '純資産額' (Net Assets) and '総資産額' (Total Assets), which could indicate potential earnings management or misrepresentation of asset values.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant increase in outflows, from -67,242,000,000 JPY in the prior year to -165,549,000,000 JPY in the current year. This sharp increase in investment outflows, coupled with the drastic change in financing cash flows, could indicate potential misallocation of funds or an attempt to inflate asset values.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Revenue and Profit Trends**: While '売上高' (Revenue) has increased slightly from the prior year, '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit) and '営業利益' (Operating Profit) have both decreased significantly. This inconsistency could suggest issues with cost management, revenue recognition, or other operational inefficiencies.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Specific Accounts**: Certain accounts, such as '短期借入金' (Short-Term Borrowings), have increased significantly from 184,362,000,000 JPY to 319,720,000,000 JPY. This sharp increase in short-term debt could indicate liquidity issues or aggressive financing strategies.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: The absence of data for '社債の発行による収入' (Proceeds from Bond Issuance) in the current year, despite its presence in the prior year, raises questions about the company's financing strategy and whether this omission is intentional or due to a reporting error.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation, particularly around the company's financing and investment activities, as well as its declining profitability metrics."}

Similarly, '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) also decreased from 14.01 billion yen to 2.25 billion yen. While these changes may be legitimate, the significant fluctuations in extraordinary items warrant further scrutiny to ensure they are not being used to manipulate profits.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') decreased from 50.56 billion yen in the prior year to 42.00 billion yen in the current year, despite an increase in net income ('当期利益'). This could indicate potential issues with cash collection or revenue recognition practices.\n\n3. **Significant Increase in Intangible Assets**: The '無形固定資産' (intangible fixed assets) increased significantly from 8.92 billion yen to 25.80 billion yen. This sharp increase could be due to acquisitions or capitalization of development costs, but it should be verified to ensure proper accounting treatment and valuation.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Debt Structure**: The issuance of bonds ('社債の発行による収入') increased from 10 billion yen to 20 billion yen, while the redemption of bonds ('社債の償還による支出') decreased from 10 billion yen to 5.04 billion yen. This change in debt structure should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the company's financial strategy and does not mask liquidity issues.\n\n5. **Non-Disclosure of Diluted EPS**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) is not disclosed ('－') for all years. While this may be due to the absence of dilutive securities, it is worth confirming to ensure transparency.\n\n6. **Consistency in Depreciation and Amortization**: The depreciation and amortization expenses ('減価償却費及び償却費') remain relatively stable, which is expected. However, given the significant changes in fixed assets, it is worth verifying whether the depreciation policies are consistent and appropriate.\n\nOverall, while there are no definitive signs of fraud, the above points suggest areas that require further investigation to rule out potential manipulation or misrepresentation."}

Similarly, '経常利益' (ordinary profit) and '当期純利益' (net income) have also decreased drastically, with the current year showing a net loss. This trend could indicate operational challenges, but it is not necessarily fraudulent. \n\n2. **Mismatch in Comprehensive Income ('包括利益') and Net Income ('当期純利益')**: While the company reported a net loss for the current year, comprehensive income has increased significantly. This discrepancy could be due to unrealized gains on securities or other non-operational factors, but it warrants further investigation to ensure these gains are legitimate and not manipulated.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Shareholder Equity**: The company's '自己株式' (treasury stock) has decreased significantly, which could indicate a large sale of treasury shares. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it is worth investigating the purpose and timing of this transaction, especially given the company's declining profitability.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has increased significantly despite declining revenue and profitability. This could be due to changes in working capital or other non-operational factors, but it raises questions about the sustainability of cash flow generation.\n\n5. **Unusual Increase in Fixed Assets**: The company's '有形固定資産' (tangible fixed assets) has increased slightly despite declining revenue and profitability. This could indicate capital expenditures that are not aligned with the company's financial performance, which may require further scrutiny.\n\n6. **Potential Overstatement of Deferred Tax Assets**: The increase in '繰延税金資産' (deferred tax assets) despite a net loss and declining profitability could indicate aggressive accounting practices. Deferred tax assets should be supported by a reasonable expectation of future taxable income, which seems uncertain given the company's current performance.\n\n7. **Lack of Disclosure on Certain Items**: The absence of data for '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share) and '現金及び現金同等物に係る換算差額' (translation adjustments for cash and cash equivalents) is unusual. While this may be due to legitimate reasons, it could also indicate a lack of transparency.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation.

This inconsistency warrants further investigation.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from operating activities has decreased significantly from 1,704,109,000 yen in the prior year to 1,003,598,000 yen in the current year, despite an increase in net income. This could indicate issues with cash collection or potential manipulation of working capital accounts.\n\n3. **Significant Changes in Long-Term Borrowing**: There is a large increase in long-term borrowing (from 50,000,000 yen in the prior year to 1,570,000,000 yen in the current year). While this could be legitimate, the purpose of this borrowing is not clear from the report and should be clarified.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Fixed Asset Transactions**: The report shows a fixed asset sale gain of 13,468,000 yen in the current year, but the corresponding cash inflow from the sale of tangible fixed assets is 14,859,000 yen. While the difference is not large, it is worth verifying the accuracy of these transactions.\n\n5. **Significant Decrease in Lease Assets**: The value of lease assets has dropped significantly from 5,466,508,000 yen in the prior year to 2,602,824,000 yen in the current year. This is a substantial change that should be explained, as it could indicate a change in leasing strategy or potential asset reclassification.\n\n6. **Unusual Trends in Special Gains and Losses**: The prior year included a significant gain from the sale of investment securities (325,080,000 yen), which is absent in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it could indicate reliance on non-recurring gains to boost prior-year profits.\n\n7. **Self-Stock Acquisition**: The company acquired its own stock for 54,043,000 yen in the current year, which is a new activity compared to the prior year. This could be a legitimate action, but it is worth understanding the rationale behind this decision.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further clarification or investigation to rule out potential irregularities."}

This discrepancy suggests that there may be significant unrealized losses or other adjustments affecting comprehensive income, which are not clearly explained in the report.\n\n2. **Investment Securities (投資有価証券):** The balance of investment securities dropped significantly from 5,999,858,000 in the Prior Year to 4,529,019,000 in the Current Year. This is a substantial decrease, and while there is a reported gain from the sale of investment securities (325,080,000), the report does not provide sufficient details about the nature of these transactions or the reasons for the large reduction in the balance.\n\n3. **Special Gains and Losses (特別利益合計 and 特別損失合計):** The Current Year includes a large special gain (325,080,000) and a significant special loss (232,841,000). The report does not provide detailed explanations for these items, which could indicate an attempt to manipulate earnings or obscure the true financial performance.\n\n4. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities (投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー):** The cash flow from investing activities turned positive in the Current Year (164,669,000) after being negative for several years. This is unusual and may indicate one-time transactions, such as the sale of investment securities, which are not sustainable sources of cash flow.\n\n5. **Employee Count (従業員数):** The number of employees has been steadily declining over the years, from 919 in the Prior 4 Year to 853 in the Current Year. While this could be due to operational efficiency, it may also indicate financial stress or downsizing, which is not explicitly addressed in the report.\n\n6. **Deferred Tax Liabilities (繰延税金負債):** Deferred tax liabilities decreased significantly from 738,466,000 in the Prior Year to 341,384,000 in the Current Year. This large reduction is not explained and could indicate aggressive tax planning or adjustments.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Key Ratios:** The return on equity (自己資本利益率) improved from -0.002 in the Prior Year to 0.012 in the Current Year, and the price-to-earnings ratio (株価収益率) increased to 32.0. These changes may not align with the overall financial performance and could suggest earnings management.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest the possibility of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices.

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow has significantly decreased from 16.37 billion yen in the prior year to 6.32 billion yen in the current year, despite a relatively stable net income. This sharp decline in operating cash flow is not fully explained by the changes in other cash flow components, which could indicate potential manipulation or misclassification of cash flows.\n\n2. **Unusual Gains from Fixed Asset Sales**: The company reported a significant increase in gains from the sale of fixed assets, from 775 million yen in the prior year to 7.79 billion yen in the current year. This is a substantial jump and could be an attempt to inflate profits artificially. Additionally, the corresponding cash inflow from the sale of fixed assets in the cash flow statement also increased significantly, which might warrant further investigation into the nature of these transactions.\n\n3. **Decline in Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income has turned negative in the current year (-6.56 billion yen) after being positive in the prior year (8.61 billion yen). This is primarily due to a significant drop in 'Other Comprehensive Income' components, such as valuation differences on available-for-sale securities. While this could be due to market conditions, the magnitude of the change raises questions about the valuation methods or potential write-downs.\n\n4. **Inconsistencies in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The balance sheet shows an increase in 'Cash and Deposits' from 81.41 billion yen to 90.71 billion yen, but the cash flow statement shows a significant decrease in 'Cash and Cash Equivalents' from 75.72 billion yen to 61.66 billion yen. This discrepancy suggests potential misclassification or errors in reporting.\n\n5. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company reported a significant inflow from long-term borrowings (10 billion yen) in the current year, which is unusual given the absence of such borrowings in the prior year. This sudden increase in debt could indicate liquidity issues or an attempt to cover up cash flow problems.\n\n6. **Decline in Revenue and Profitability**: The company's revenue and operating profit have been declining consistently over the past few years. While this could be due to market conditions, the consistent decline, coupled with the other red flags, raises concerns about the company's financial health and reporting practices.\n\n7. **Unexplained Changes in Accounts Receivable and Payable**: The accounts receivable decreased significantly, while accounts payable also decreased. These changes could be normal business activities, but the magnitude and timing of these changes warrant further scrutiny.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest a moderate probability of fraudulent activities."}

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Comprehensive Income (包括利益)**: The comprehensive income for the current year is reported as a significant negative value (-10,734,000,000), which is a sharp decline compared to prior years. This is inconsistent with the reported increase in operating profit (営業利益) and ordinary profit (経常利益). A negative comprehensive income despite positive operating and ordinary profits could indicate issues with unrealized losses or other adjustments that are not clearly explained.\n\n2. **Stock Price Earnings Ratio (株価収益率)**: The P/E ratio has increased dramatically from 62.7 in the prior year to 209.3 in the current year. This is an unusually high value and could indicate overvaluation or manipulation of earnings to maintain stock prices.\n\n3. **Deferred Tax Assets (繰延税金資産)**: The deferred tax assets have decreased significantly from 4,244,000,000 in the prior year to 3,050,000,000 in the current year. This could indicate a lack of confidence in future profitability, which is inconsistent with the reported increase in operating profit.\n\n4. **Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (貸倒引当金)**: The allowance for doubtful accounts has decreased significantly from -1,509,000,000 in the prior year to -880,000,000 in the current year. This could indicate aggressive accounting practices to inflate net assets.\n\n5. **Special Losses (特別損失合計)**: The special losses have more than doubled from 15,628,000,000 in the prior year to 34,377,000,000 in the current year. This includes a significant increase in impairment losses (減損損失), which could indicate poor asset management or an attempt to 'clean up' the balance sheet.\n\n6. **Cash Flow from Financing Activities (財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー)**: The cash flow from financing activities remains negative, but the repayment of long-term borrowings has increased significantly, which could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n7. **Employee Numbers (従業員数)**: The number of employees has remained relatively stable, but the average number of temporary employees has decreased significantly. This could indicate cost-cutting measures that are not aligned with the reported increase in profitability.\n\n8. **Unusual Adjustments in Cash Flow (貸倒引当金の増減額)**: The allowance for doubtful accounts adjustment in the cash flow statement shows a significant increase (14,115,000,000), which is inconsistent with the decrease in the balance sheet. This discrepancy could indicate manipulation of cash flow figures.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, these logical inconsistencies and unusual trends suggest the possibility of aggressive accounting practices or even fraud.

While this could be due to legitimate business reasons, such drastic changes often warrant scrutiny.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flows**: The cash flow from operating activities (営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) dropped significantly from the prior year, despite a substantial increase in net income. This inconsistency between profitability and cash flow generation could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting manipulations.\n\n3. **Inventory and Accounts Receivable Growth**: The inventory (棚卸資産) and accounts receivable (売上債権) have increased significantly, which could indicate potential issues with revenue recognition or overstatement of assets. This is especially concerning given the decline in sales (売上高).\n\n4. **Reduction in Depreciation**: The depreciation expense for buildings and machinery (減価償却累計額) has decreased significantly, which could suggest changes in accounting estimates or policies. This might be an attempt to inflate profits.\n\n5. **Employee Count Decline**: The number of employees (従業員数) has decreased consistently over the years, which could indicate operational downsizing. However, this is not reflected in a proportional reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses (販売費及び一般管理費), raising questions about cost management.\n\n6. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company shows a significant inflow from long-term borrowings (長期借入れによる収入) and a reduction in short-term borrowings (短期借入金の純増減額). While this could be part of a legitimate financial strategy, it might also indicate liquidity issues or an attempt to mask operational cash flow problems.\n\n7. **Omission of Diluted EPS**: The absence of diluted earnings per share (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) data across all years is unusual and could indicate a lack of transparency regarding potential equity dilution.\n\n8. **Tax Adjustments**: The significant swing in deferred tax adjustments (法人税等調整額) from a large negative value in the prior year to a large positive value in the current year is unusual and could indicate aggressive tax planning or manipulation.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that should be investigated further."}

The company's '包括利益' (comprehensive income) has shown significant volatility over the years, dropping from 2,149 million yen in the prior year to 1,407 million yen in the current year. This is despite an increase in sales revenue ('売上高') and a relatively stable net income ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'). Such a discrepancy could indicate issues with unrealized gains or losses, or other components of comprehensive income that are not clearly explained.\n\n2. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a significant increase in outflows compared to the prior year, from -997 million yen to -1,925 million yen. This is coupled with a notable increase in '有形固定資産の売却による収入' (proceeds from the sale of tangible fixed assets) from 1 million yen to 247 million yen. The sudden increase in asset sales could be an attempt to boost cash flow artificially, especially if the assets sold are critical to operations.\n\n3. The '自己株式の取得による支出' (expenditure for acquiring treasury stock) increased significantly from 3 million yen to 184 million yen. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it could be a strategy to manipulate earnings per share (EPS) or other financial metrics.\n\n4. The '投資有価証券売却益' (gain on sale of investment securities) increased significantly from 17 million yen to 334 million yen. This could indicate reliance on non-operating income to support profitability, which may not be sustainable in the long term.\n\n5. The '現金及び現金同等物の増減額' (net change in cash and cash equivalents) shows a significant decrease of 535 million yen in the current year, despite a relatively stable operating cash flow. This could indicate potential liquidity issues or mismanagement of cash flows.\n\n6. The '従業員数' (number of employees) decreased slightly from 2,223 to 2,222, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) increased from 1,120 to 1,175. This shift towards more temporary employees could be a cost-cutting measure, but it might also indicate potential labor-related issues or an attempt to reduce long-term liabilities.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further scrutiny.

This could indicate a one-time event in the prior year that inflated profits, but the lack of explanation for such a drastic change is a red flag.\n\n2. **Negative Cash Flow in Prior Years**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) was negative four years ago (-7,198,000,000 yen) but has since improved significantly. While this could be due to operational improvements, the sudden turnaround should be scrutinized to ensure it is not the result of aggressive accounting practices.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Extraordinary Losses**: The '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) increased from 716,000,000 yen to 967,000,000 yen, which is not inherently suspicious but should be explained in the notes to the financial statements. The lack of detailed breakdowns for these items could obscure the true nature of these losses.\n\n4. **Decline in Inventory and Fixed Assets**: The '商品及び製品' (finished goods and products) and '原材料及び貯蔵品' (raw materials and supplies) have decreased significantly, which could indicate operational efficiency or potential write-offs. Similarly, the '無形固定資産' (intangible fixed assets) have decreased, which might suggest impairments or disposals. These changes should be supported by detailed disclosures.\n\n5. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (adjustments to corporate taxes) shows a significant negative adjustment (-317,000,000 yen) in the current year compared to a positive adjustment in the prior year. This could indicate aggressive tax planning or the reversal of prior tax provisions.\n\n6. **Employee Count Decline**: The number of employees has steadily decreased over the years, from 1,908 four years ago to 1,581 in the current year. While this could be due to restructuring or efficiency improvements, it may also indicate financial stress or operational downsizing.\n\n7. **Lack of Data for Diluted EPS**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) is consistently missing ('－') across all years. While this may not be unusual for some companies, it could indicate a lack of transparency regarding potential dilution effects.\n\n8. **Significant Changes in Debt Structure**: The '長期借入金' (long-term borrowings) has decreased significantly, while '短期借入金' (short-term borrowings) remain relatively stable. This could indicate a shift in the company's financing strategy, which should be explained in the management discussion and analysis section.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation or clarification.

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: The company reported a significant positive cash flow from investing activities in the current year (9,656,000,000 yen), which is a stark contrast to consistent negative cash flows in prior years. This sudden shift is unusual and warrants further investigation into the source of this cash inflow, particularly since it is not common for investing activities to generate such a large positive cash flow unless there is a major asset sale or similar event. \n\n2. **Fixed Asset Sale**: The company reported a significant gain from the sale of fixed assets (7,316,000,000 yen) in the current year, which aligns with the positive cash flow from investing activities. However, the report does not provide sufficient details about the nature of the assets sold, the buyer, or the rationale for the sale. This lack of transparency could be a red flag. \n\n3. **Decline in Tangible Fixed Assets**: The balance sheet shows a notable decline in tangible fixed assets (from 44,525,000,000 yen to 38,733,000,000 yen). While this aligns with the reported asset sale, the magnitude of the decline and its impact on the company's operations are not clearly explained. \n\n4. **Unusual Financial Activities**: The company reported a significant outflow in financing activities (-11,920,000,000 yen) in the current year, compared to a small inflow in the prior year. This includes a large repayment of long-term borrowings (-16,409,000,000 yen) despite a relatively modest inflow from new borrowings (7,150,000,000 yen). This could indicate liquidity management issues or an attempt to reduce debt aggressively, but the rationale is unclear. \n\n5. **Profitability Trends**: The company's net income has increased significantly in the current year (9,462,000,000 yen) compared to the prior year (6,983,000,000 yen), despite a decline in operating profit (from 11,104,000,000 yen to 8,314,000,000 yen). This discrepancy is primarily due to the gain from the fixed asset sale, which is a non-recurring item. This reliance on non-operating income to boost profitability could be a red flag. \n\n6. **Employee Count**: The number of employees has been steadily declining over the years, from 1,923 four years ago to 1,604 in the current year. While this could be due to operational efficiency improvements, it could also indicate potential downsizing or financial stress. \n\n7. **Deferred Tax Assets**: The deferred tax assets have decreased significantly (from 2,263,000,000 yen to 1,096,000,000 yen), which could indicate changes in the company's tax position or profitability expectations. This warrants further clarification. \n\n8. **Unusual Items in Cash Flow Statement**: The cash flow statement includes some unusual items, such as a significant increase in accounts receivable (3,286,000,000 yen) and a decrease in accounts payable (-1,513,000,000 yen). These changes could indicate potential issues with working capital management. \n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above observations suggest potential red flags that warrant further investigation.

Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Sudden Reversal in Profitability**: The company reported a significant loss in the prior year (-1,017,000,000 yen in parent company net income) but then showed a sharp recovery to a profit of 1,191,000,000 yen in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, such a drastic turnaround should be supported by clear explanations, such as major operational changes, cost reductions, or one-time gains. However, the report does not provide sufficient context for this recovery.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Income Decline**: Despite the reported profitability improvement, comprehensive income turned negative in the current year (-119,000,000 yen) compared to a positive figure in the prior year (1,547,000,000 yen). This discrepancy between net income and comprehensive income could indicate unreported or poorly explained losses in other areas, such as foreign exchange adjustments or unrealized losses on securities.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The operating cash flow increased significantly from 2,439,000,000 yen in the prior year to 4,912,000,000 yen in the current year, which is inconsistent with the decline in revenue (from 57,059,000,000 yen to 50,494,000,000 yen). This could suggest aggressive working capital management or potential manipulation of cash flow figures.\n\n4. **Decline in Revenue and Assets**: Revenue and total assets both declined in the current year, which is inconsistent with the reported improvement in profitability. This raises questions about the sustainability of the reported profit growth.\n\n5. **Unexplained Changes in Key Accounts**: There are significant changes in certain balance sheet accounts, such as a decrease in accounts receivable (from 17,689,000,000 yen to 15,408,000,000 yen) and an increase in cash and deposits (from 4,373,000,000 yen to 5,631,000,000 yen). These changes are not adequately explained and could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting adjustments.\n\n6. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The effective tax rate appears to have decreased significantly, as the total tax expense dropped from 1,536,000,000 yen in the prior year to 679,000,000 yen in the current year, despite the increase in pre-tax income. This could indicate the use of tax strategies or adjustments that are not fully disclosed.\n\n7. **Employee Count Decline**: The number of employees decreased from 3,688 to 3,444, which could indicate cost-cutting measures. However, this is not reflected in a proportional reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, which only decreased slightly.\n\n8. **Unexplained Write-Downs**: The report includes a significant reduction in impairment losses (from 1,571,000,000 yen to 361,000,000 yen), but there is no explanation for the prior year's high impairment or the current year's reduction.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further investigation.

This discrepancy could be due to the large increase in extraordinary losses (e.g., impairment losses of 1,571,000,000 yen). While this is not inherently fraudulent, the sudden spike in extraordinary losses should be scrutinized to ensure they are legitimate.\n\n2. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (tax adjustments) jumped significantly from -404,000,000 yen in the prior year to 901,000,000 yen in the current year. This is a substantial swing and could indicate aggressive tax planning or manipulation of deferred tax assets/liabilities. This warrants further investigation.\n\n3. **Decline in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents dropped significantly from 4,269,000,000 yen in the prior year to 2,787,000,000 yen in the current year. This is despite positive operating cash flow (2,439,000,000 yen). The decline is primarily due to negative cash flows from investing and financing activities. While this is not inherently fraudulent, the company’s liquidity position should be closely monitored.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Asset and Liability Trends**: The company’s total assets decreased slightly, but liabilities decreased more significantly, leading to an increase in the equity ratio. However, the decrease in liabilities is primarily due to a reduction in short-term borrowings, which could indicate potential liquidity issues or an attempt to improve financial ratios artificially.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Deferred Tax Assets**: The deferred tax assets under '繰延税金資産' decreased significantly from 363,000,000 yen to 245,000,000 yen. This could be due to changes in tax planning or adjustments, but the reasons for this change should be clarified.\n\n6. **Impairment Losses**: The significant increase in impairment losses (from 457,000,000 yen to 1,571,000,000 yen) is notable. While impairment losses are not uncommon, the sudden spike should be investigated to ensure they are justified and not used to manipulate earnings.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Other Comprehensive Income**: The '包括利益' (comprehensive income) dropped significantly from 2,928,000,000 yen in the prior year to 1,547,000,000 yen in the current year. This is inconsistent with the increase in equity and should be further analyzed.\n\n8. **Potential Overstatement of Revenue**: While revenue increased, the corresponding increase in accounts receivable ('受取手形及び売掛金') from 16,376,000,000 yen to 17,689,000,000 yen could indicate potential revenue recognition issues. This should be investigated to ensure that revenue is not being overstated.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above points suggest potential areas of concern that warrant further investigation.

This is primarily driven by a significant increase in short-term borrowings (3,925,556,000 yen). While this could be legitimate, such a drastic change in financing activities should be scrutinized to ensure it aligns with the company's operational needs and strategy.\n\n2. **Large Increase in Investment Cash Outflows**: The investment cash flow shows a significant increase in outflows, from -2,277,649,000 yen in the prior year to -4,713,122,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or investments, but the corresponding increase in tangible fixed assets (e.g., machinery and buildings) should be verified to ensure the investments are legitimate and not overstated.\n\n3. **Negative Goodwill Gain**: The report includes a 'negative goodwill gain' of 117,170,000 yen in the current year, which was absent in the prior year. Negative goodwill can occur when a company acquires another company at a price below its fair value.

These changes could indicate potential issues with inventory management or payment practices and should be reviewed for consistency with operational activities.\n\n5. **Discrepancy in Deferred Tax Assets**: The deferred tax assets ('繰延税金資産') increased significantly from 75,164,000 yen to 174,456,000 yen. This could be legitimate, but the underlying reasons (e.g., tax loss carryforwards or temporary differences) should be verified to ensure they are not overstated.\n\n6. **Unusual Increase in Intangible Fixed Assets**: The intangible fixed assets increased significantly from 235,245,000 yen to 813,828,000 yen. This could indicate new acquisitions or capitalized development costs, but the details should be reviewed to ensure they are legitimate and not inflated.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to rule out potential manipulation or misrepresentation."}

This is a drastic change and is not consistent with the relatively stable revenue and profit figures. A negative operating cash flow despite reported profits could indicate issues with revenue recognition or cash management.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**: The allowance for doubtful accounts decreased significantly (-762 million yen) in the current year, which could artificially inflate profits. This change is not explained in the report and could be a sign of aggressive accounting practices.\n\n3. **Inventory Build-Up**: There is a significant increase in inventory (2.47 billion yen), which could indicate overproduction or unsold goods. This could be a sign of channel stuffing or an attempt to inflate revenue figures.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance decreased significantly (3.12 billion yen), which is not fully explained by the cash flow activities. This could indicate unreported liabilities or mismanagement of cash.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Short-Term and Long-Term Borrowings**: There is a significant increase in short-term borrowings (307 million yen) and a sharp decrease in long-term borrowings. This shift in financing strategy is not explained and could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n6. **High Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: The P/E ratio has increased significantly to 27.9 in the current year from 14.9 in the prior year. This could indicate overvaluation or market expectations that are not aligned with the company's financial performance.\n\n7. **Unexplained Changes in Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: There are notable changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are not explained in the report. This could indicate tax-related adjustments that may not be transparent.\n\n8. **Lack of Disclosure on Diluted Earnings Per Share**: The report does not provide information on diluted earnings per share (EPS) for any year, which is unusual and could indicate a lack of transparency.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further investigation. The combination of negative operating cash flow, significant changes in allowances, inventory build-up, and unexplained financial adjustments raises the probability of potential fraudulent activities."}

While this could be due to genuine operational challenges, it raises concerns about the company's financial health and management practices.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant positive value in the current year (2,237 million yen) after years of consistent negative values. This sudden shift could indicate asset sales or other one-time activities, which should be scrutinized further to ensure they are not being used to manipulate cash flow figures.\n\n3. **Significant Special Losses**: The '特別損失合計' (Total Special Losses) has increased significantly in the current year, primarily due to '減損損失' (Impairment Losses) and '投資有価証券評価損' (Investment Securities Valuation Losses). While these may be legitimate, the timing and magnitude of these losses should be examined to ensure they are not being used to mask operational issues.\n\n4. **Self-Share Acquisition**: The company has been aggressively acquiring its own shares ('自己株式の取得による支出'), with a significant expenditure in the current year. This could be a legitimate strategy to boost shareholder value, but it could also be a tactic to manipulate stock prices or earnings per share.\n\n5. **Declining Equity**: The '純資産額' (Net Assets) has been declining consistently over the years, which is a concerning trend. This could indicate that the company is struggling to generate sufficient returns to maintain its equity base.\n\n6. **Unusual Asset Movements**: The 'リース資産' (Lease Assets) shows a significant increase in the current year, which is unusual and warrants further investigation to understand the nature of these assets and their impact on the financial statements.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to ensure the integrity of the financial statements."}

While this could be due to market conditions or other external factors, such a sharp decline should be explained in the report. The absence of a clear explanation could be a concern.\n\n2. **Mismatch in Profitability Trends**: Despite the significant drop in revenue, the company's operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') has increased from 9,774,000,000 to 10,750,000,000. This is unusual because a decline in revenue typically leads to a decline in cash flow unless there are significant cost-cutting measures or changes in working capital. The report does not provide sufficient details to explain this anomaly.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Working Capital**: The cash flow statement shows a large increase in accounts receivable ('売上債権の増減額') of 7,114,000,000, which is inconsistent with the drop in revenue. Additionally, there is a significant decrease in accounts payable ('仕入債務の増減額') of 2,093,000,000. These changes in working capital could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or other manipulations.\n\n4. **Inventory Management**: The inventory ('棚卸資産') has decreased, which aligns with the drop in revenue. However, the decrease in inventory is not proportional to the revenue decline, which could indicate potential issues with inventory valuation or write-offs.\n\n5. **Unusual Share Buyback**: The company has significantly increased its share buyback ('自己株式の取得による支出') from 8,000,000 to 501,000,000. This is a substantial increase and could be an attempt to artificially inflate the stock price or earnings per share.\n\n6. **Decline in Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income ('包括利益') has dropped significantly over the years, from 12,330,000,000 two years ago to 1,414,000,000 in the current year. This trend is concerning and should be explained in the report.\n\n7. **Foreign Exchange Adjustments**: The foreign exchange adjustment account ('為替換算調整勘定') has shifted from a positive 2,676,000,000 to a negative 31,000,000.

While this is not inherently fraudulent, such a sharp turnaround should be supported by clear and credible explanations in the report, such as operational improvements, cost reductions, or one-time gains. \n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flows**: The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant positive swing from 2.237 billion yen in the prior year to 867 million yen in the current year. This is unusual given the company's historical trend of negative cash flows from investing activities. The report should clarify the reasons for this change, such as asset sales or reduced capital expenditures.\n\n3. **Reduction in Long-Term Debt**: The '長期借入金' (Long-Term Borrowings) dropped significantly from 2.712 billion yen in the prior year to just 2 million yen in the current year. This is an unusual change and should be explained, as it could indicate debt restructuring, repayment, or reclassification.\n\n4. **Sharp Increase in '自己株式' (Treasury Stock)**: The company's treasury stock increased significantly from -9.019 billion yen to -12.642 billion yen. This suggests aggressive share buybacks, which could be a strategy to inflate earnings per share (EPS) or manipulate stock prices. The rationale for such buybacks should be clearly disclosed.\n\n5. **Discrepancies in '営業外収益' (Non-Operating Income)**: The '営業外収益' dropped from 1.122 billion yen in the prior year to 824 million yen in the current year, despite an increase in operating profit. This inconsistency should be explained, as it could indicate changes in non-operating activities or one-time adjustments.\n\n6. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (Tax Adjustments) increased significantly from 162 million yen in the prior year to 855 million yen in the current year. This could indicate changes in tax strategies or deferred tax assets/liabilities, which should be clarified.\n\n7. **Lack of Detail on '特別利益' (Extraordinary Gains)**: The '特別利益合計' (Total Extraordinary Gains) dropped from 96 million yen in the prior year to 32 million yen in the current year.

This is not necessarily fraudulent but could be a red flag if the company has convertible securities or stock options that are not disclosed.\n2. The '現金及び現金同等物の増減額' (Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents) shows a significant decrease in the current year (-1,064,669,000 yen), which is not fully explained by the cash flow activities. While the cash flow from investing activities is negative, the operating cash flow is positive, and the financing cash flow is less negative compared to the prior year. This discrepancy could warrant further investigation.\n3. The '為替換算調整勘定' (Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment) has decreased significantly from 1,377,147,000 yen in the prior year to 908,017,000 yen in the current year.

The '従業員数' (Number of Employees) has increased significantly from 1,727 to 2,071, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) has decreased from 778 to 685.

This is a substantial jump (approximately 43%) and is not accompanied by a proportional increase in revenue or profitability. Such a large increase in fixed assets without clear justification could indicate asset inflation or misrepresentation.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The cash flow from investing activities shows a significant outflow of -166,493 million yen in the current year compared to -55,077 million yen in the prior year. This is a threefold increase in outflows, which is not clearly explained in the report. Additionally, the cash flow from financing activities shows a large inflow of 100,223 million yen, which is a stark contrast to the outflow of -6,395 million yen in the prior year. Such drastic changes in cash flow patterns could indicate potential manipulation or unusual financial structuring.\n\n3. **Decline in Profitability Metrics**: The company's net income attributable to parent shareholders dropped significantly from 36,307 million yen in the prior year to 18,787 million yen in the current year. Similarly, the return on equity (ROE) dropped from 10.96% to 5.46%.

This could suggest aggressive tax planning or underreporting of taxable income.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The '営業キャッシュフロー' (operating cash flow) dropped significantly from 5,228,868,000 in the 'Prior1Year' to 1,236,539,000 in the 'CurrentYear', despite only a modest decline in '経常利益' (ordinary income). This discrepancy between cash flow and profit could indicate issues with revenue recognition or collection of receivables.\n\n4. **Unexplained Changes in Liabilities**: The '未払法人税等' (unpaid corporate taxes) dropped sharply from 690,290,000 in the 'Prior1Year' to 59,553,000 in the 'CurrentYear'. This is unusual given the company's profitability and could suggest underpayment or deferral of taxes.\n\n5. **Significant Changes in Non-Current Liabilities**: The '退職給付に係る負債' (retirement benefit liabilities) decreased significantly from 1,295,715,000 in the 'Prior1Year' to 804,906,000 in the 'CurrentYear'.

This could indicate potential issues with cash management or an attempt to obscure the true financial position.\n\n8. **Omission of Certain Revenue and Expense Details**: Some revenue and expense details, such as 'その他' (other income/expenses), are missing or not disclosed for the current year. This lack of transparency could be a red flag.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively prove fraud, they warrant further investigation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}
{"edinet_code": "E01330", "doc_id": "S1005791", "label": 0, "prob": 0.6, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The financial data provided appears consistent from a numerical perspective, and the report has been verified by a certified public accountant. However, there are several logical red flags and inconsistencies that could suggest potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **Unusual Growth in Revenue and Assets**: The company's revenue ('売上高') has grown significantly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear' (364,107 million yen to 572,541 million yen, a 57% increase). Similarly, total assets ('総資産額') have increased substantially (608,490 million yen to 677,952 million yen). While growth is not inherently suspicious, such rapid increases should be supported by clear explanations, such as new product launches, market expansions, or acquisitions, none of which are mentioned in the provided data.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has more than doubled from 'Prior2Year' to 'Prior1Year' (3,851 to 8,418) and increased further to 8,556 in 'CurrentYear'. This sharp increase in workforce should align with the company's operational expansion or revenue growth, but no specific details are provided to justify this.\n\n3. **Decline in Profitability Ratios**: Despite the significant revenue growth, key profitability ratios such as '自己資本利益率' (ROE) have declined from 0.086 in 'Prior1Year' to 0.053 in 'CurrentYear'. This suggests that the company is not efficiently converting its equity into profit, which is unusual given the revenue growth.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Concerns**: The company's cash flow from operating activities ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has increased significantly, but this is offset by a dramatic increase in cash outflows from investing activities ('投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー'). The large negative cash flow from investing activities (-49,668 million yen in 'CurrentYear') could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or investments, but the lack of detailed explanations raises questions about the nature of these investments.\n\n5. **Debt Management**: The company has significantly increased its short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') from 42,094 million yen in 'Prior1Year' to 80,100 million yen in 'CurrentYear'. This, combined with a high level of long-term debt, suggests a reliance on external financing, which could be a red flag if not supported by strong operational performance.\n\n6. **Unusual Changes in Special Items**: The '特別利益合計' (extraordinary income) has dropped significantly from 6,256 million yen in 'Prior1Year' to 489 million yen in 'CurrentYear', while '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) have also decreased. These fluctuations in special items should be explained, as they can sometimes be used to manipulate reported profits.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Tax Payments**: The company's tax payments ('法人税等の支払額') have more than doubled from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear' (2,959 million yen to 6,448 million yen), which is not proportionate to the increase in pre-tax profit ('税引前利益'). This inconsistency warrants further investigation.\n\n8. **Missing Data**: The absence of data for '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) across all years is unusual and could indicate a lack of transparency regarding potential dilution effects.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further scrutiny. The combination of rapid growth, declining profitability ratios, significant changes in cash flows, and unexplained fluctuations in key metrics suggests a moderate probability of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices."}

However, there are a few points that could raise concerns or warrant further investigation: \n\n1. **Unusual Increase in Operating Cash Flow**: The operating cash flow jumped significantly from 1,073,633,000 yen in the prior year to 5,187,564,000 yen in the current year. This is a substantial increase that is not proportionate to the increase in net income or revenue. While this could be due to legitimate reasons such as changes in working capital, it warrants further scrutiny to ensure there are no manipulations in working capital accounts (e.g., accounts receivable or inventory).\n\n2. **Significant Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: The accounts receivable (売上債権) decreased drastically from 13,639,505,000 yen in the prior year to 10,294,913,000 yen in the current year. This decrease is a major contributor to the spike in operating cash flow. While this could be due to improved collections, it is worth investigating whether this is a result of aggressive revenue recognition practices in prior periods or other unusual activities.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Inventory and Payables**: The inventory (棚卸資産) shows a small increase, while accounts payable (仕入債務) increased by 219,699,000 yen. These changes, combined with the drastic decrease in accounts receivable, could indicate potential manipulation of working capital accounts to inflate cash flow.\n\n4. **Significant Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance increased significantly from 3,395,541,000 yen to 7,472,589,000 yen. This is consistent with the large operating cash flow, but the magnitude of the increase should be cross-verified with actual bank statements or other supporting documents.\n\n5. **No Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: The report indicates that there are no diluted EPS figures (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) for any of the years. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it is unusual for a company of this size to not have any potential dilutive securities, such as stock options or convertible bonds. This could be a point to verify.\n\n6. **Unusual Fixed Asset Sale**: The report shows a fixed asset sale gain of 23,296,000 yen in the current year, while there was no such gain in the prior year. Although the amount is not material, it is worth confirming the legitimacy of this transaction.\n\n7. **Decrease in Deferred Tax Liabilities**: The deferred tax liabilities (繰延税金負債) decreased from 3,960,000 yen to 2,648,000 yen. While this is a small amount, it is worth ensuring that the tax accounting is accurate and consistent.\n\nOverall, while there are no definitive signs of fraud, the significant changes in operating cash flow, accounts receivable, and cash balances warrant further investigation to rule out any potential manipulation."}

These include: \n1. A significant and sudden drop in key financial metrics such as '売上高' (sales revenue), '経常利益' (ordinary profit), and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders) in the current year compared to prior years. While economic downturns or industry-specific challenges could explain this, the magnitude of the decline (-698,878,000 yen in net income) is concerning. \n2. A large increase in '貸倒引当金' (allowance for doubtful accounts) from -2,487,000 yen in the prior year to -519,468,000 yen in the current year. This suggests a significant deterioration in the quality of receivables, which could indicate aggressive revenue recognition in prior periods or issues with customer creditworthiness. \n3. The '営業キャッシュフロー' (operating cash flow) turned negative (-160,243,000 yen) despite the company reporting positive '営業利益' (operating profit) of 65,135,000 yen. This discrepancy between cash flow and profit could suggest issues with revenue recognition or expense manipulation. \n4. The '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) increased dramatically to 792,524,000 yen in the current year, which is unusually high compared to prior years. This could be an attempt to 'clean the slate' by recognizing all losses in one period. \n5. The company's '従業員数' (number of employees) has been declining significantly over the years, from 350 four years ago to 136 in the current year. While this could be due to restructuring, it may also indicate operational challenges or mismanagement. \n6. The '貸倒引当金の増減額' (change in allowance for doubtful accounts) in the cash flow statement shows a massive increase of 516,981,000 yen, which aligns with the increase in the balance sheet but raises questions about the timing and accuracy of this adjustment. \n7. The '現金及び現金同等物の増減額' (change in cash and cash equivalents) shows a significant decrease of -595,201,000 yen, which is concerning given the company's financial struggles. \n8. The '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio) is negative (-1.81) in the current year, which is unusual and reflects the company's poor financial performance. \nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight inconsistencies and unusual patterns that require further investigation."}

While such a turnaround is possible, it is unusual and warrants scrutiny, especially given the company's history of fluctuating profits and losses.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Key Accounts**: There are notable changes in certain accounts that seem inconsistent with the overall financial trends:\n   - The 'Deferred Tax Assets' increased significantly from 5.9 million yen to 48.3 million yen, which is unusual given the company's prior losses and raises questions about the assumptions used to recognize these assets.\n   - The 'Inventory' accounts show a significant shift, with 'Finished Goods' decreasing sharply while 'Work in Progress' increased substantially. This could indicate potential manipulation of inventory accounts to manage profitability.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow improved dramatically from -354 million yen to 448 million yen, which is inconsistent with the company's historical performance. This improvement is not fully supported by corresponding changes in revenue or expenses, raising questions about the quality of earnings.\n\n4. **Reduction in Employee Count**: The number of employees decreased from 371 to 350, which is inconsistent with the significant increase in revenue and profitability. This could indicate potential cost-cutting measures that are not fully disclosed or a mismatch in operational capacity.\n\n5. **Unusual Special Gains and Losses**: The company reported significant 'Special Gains' (466 million yen) and a sharp reduction in 'Special Losses' (from 330 million yen to 143 million yen). These items appear to have a material impact on profitability and should be scrutinized for legitimacy.\n\n6. **Omission of Certain Data**: The absence of data for 'Diluted Earnings Per Share' (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) across all years is unusual and could indicate a lack of transparency regarding potential equity dilution.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise enough concerns to warrant further investigation into the company's financial practices and disclosures."}

Such a significant reduction in capital stock could indicate financial restructuring, but the lack of context raises concerns. Secondly, the number of employees has dropped significantly from 241 in the prior year to 141 in the current year, which is a 41.5% reduction. This is a drastic change that is not accompanied by any explanation, such as a major restructuring, divestiture, or operational downsizing. Thirdly, the '利益剰余金' (retained earnings) has shifted from a negative value of -1,237,912,000 yen in the prior year to a positive value of 1,193,128,000 yen in the current year. This dramatic turnaround in retained earnings is not supported by a corresponding increase in profitability or other financial metrics, which raises questions about the accuracy of the reported figures. Lastly, the '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) in the current year is 115,615,000 yen, which is a significant amount compared to the prior year where no extraordinary losses were reported. The lack of details about the nature of these losses is concerning.

The company's '従業員数' (number of employees) has been declining significantly over the years, from 407 in the Prior4Year to 241 in the CurrentYear. This is a 40% reduction in workforce, which is unusual given the company's increasing revenue ('売上高') and profitability ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'). A declining workforce amidst growing financial performance could indicate potential misrepresentation of operational capacity or outsourcing that is not disclosed.\n2. The '売上総利益又は売上総損失（△)' (gross profit) has decreased from the Prior1Year to the CurrentYear, despite an increase in revenue. This could suggest rising costs or inefficiencies that are not adequately explained in the report.\n3. The '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) for the CurrentYear is marked as '－', which is unusual given that extraordinary losses are typically disclosed even if they are zero.

While this could be due to operational improvements, such a large change warrants scrutiny to ensure it is not artificially inflated.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: The increase in accounts payable (仕入債務) by 260,018,000 in the current year, after a significant decrease of -211,912,000 in the prior year, is unusual. This could indicate delayed payments to suppliers to improve cash flow artificially.\n\n3. **Inventory Build-Up**: The inventory (棚卸資産) has increased significantly by -141,094,000 in the current year, compared to -53,109,000 in the prior year. This could indicate overproduction or unsold goods, which might be used to inflate revenue or hide operational inefficiencies.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Foreign Exchange Gains**: The foreign exchange gains (為替差益) reported in the prior year (17,670,000) are absent in the current year. While this could be due to market conditions, the complete absence of such gains should be verified.\n\n5. **Unusual Special Items**: The prior year includes a significant special profit (特別利益合計) of 265,025,000, which has dropped to 3,380,000 in the current year. This could indicate one-time gains in the prior year that may have been used to inflate profits.\n\n6. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The cash flow from investing activities (投資キャッシュフロー) has shifted from a positive 62,557,000 in the prior year to a negative -69,432,000 in the current year. This could indicate a sudden increase in capital expenditures or other investments, which should be verified for legitimacy.\n\n7. **Employee Count Fluctuations**: The employee count (従業員数) has fluctuated significantly over the years, dropping from 546 to 388 and then increasing to 407.

For example, revenue increased from 5.37 billion yen in the prior year to 7.44 billion yen in the current year, while net income dropped significantly from 542.5 million yen to 303.8 million yen. Such drastic changes could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or cost manipulation.\n\n2. **Employee Count Drop**: The number of employees decreased significantly from 350 in the prior year to 255 in the current year, despite the increase in revenue. This is unusual and could suggest potential misrepresentation of operational capacity or outsourcing without proper disclosure.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) dropped significantly from 448.15 million yen in the prior year to 196.12 million yen in the current year, despite the increase in revenue. This could indicate issues with revenue quality or aggressive working capital management.\n\n4. **Discrepancies in Asset and Liability Trends**: The '支払手形及び買掛金' (Accounts Payable) decreased significantly from 1.005 billion yen to 676.25 million yen, while '短期借入金' (Short-term Borrowings) also dropped from 350 million yen to 198.54 million yen. These reductions, combined with the increase in long-term borrowings, could indicate potential liquidity management issues or an attempt to improve short-term financial ratios.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Special Items**: The '特別利益合計' (Total Extraordinary Income) dropped drastically from 466.5 million yen in the prior year to 16.94 million yen in the current year, while '特別損失合計' (Total Extraordinary Loss) was zero in the current year. This could suggest manipulation of extraordinary items to smooth earnings.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Tax Payments**: The '法人税等の支払額' (Corporate Tax Payments) increased significantly from 9.9 million yen in the prior year to 159.16 million yen in the current year, despite the drop in net income. This inconsistency could indicate potential tax-related irregularities.\n\n7. **Unusual Inventory and Payable Trends**: The '棚卸資産の増減額' (Change in Inventory) shows a significant increase in inventory, while '仕入債務の増減額' (Change in Accounts Payable) shows a large decrease. This could indicate potential issues with inventory valuation or supplier payment practices.\n\n8. **Lack of Disclosure on Diluted EPS**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted EPS) is not disclosed for any year, which could indicate a lack of transparency regarding potential dilution effects.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that should be investigated further.

This could indicate potential misclassification of employees or an attempt to manipulate labor cost reporting.\n\n2. **Unusual Increase in Operating Cash Flow**: The operating cash flow jumped significantly from 14.43 billion yen in the prior year to 141.03 billion yen in the current year. This is a substantial increase that is not proportionate to changes in net income or depreciation expenses. While the increase in inventory adjustments (from -44.25 billion yen to 34.42 billion yen) partially explains this, the magnitude of the change is unusual and could indicate aggressive working capital management or potential manipulation.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Non-Controlling Interests**: The non-controlling interest in net income increased from 4 million yen to 16 million yen, while the non-controlling interest in equity only increased marginally from 60 million yen to 73 million yen. This inconsistency could suggest potential misreporting of minority interests.\n\n4. **Large Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents increased significantly from 119.04 billion yen to 166.15 billion yen, despite negative financing and investing cash flows.

This sharp decline in profitability warrants further investigation, especially since the '売上総利益' (Gross Profit) and '営業利益' (Operating Profit) also show significant declines. \n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) has decreased significantly from 3.52 billion yen in the prior year to 758 million yen in the current year. Meanwhile, '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a large outflow of 5.77 billion yen, which is significantly higher than the prior year's outflow of 3.85 billion yen. This could indicate aggressive investment or mismanagement of funds. Additionally, the '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) shows a large inflow of 5.23 billion yen, which may suggest reliance on external financing to cover operational or investment shortfalls.\n\n3. **Unexplained Increase in Short-Term Borrowings**: The '短期借入金' (Short-Term Borrowings) has increased significantly from 3.23 billion yen in the prior year to 17.19 billion yen in the current year. This sharp increase in short-term debt could indicate liquidity issues or an over-reliance on debt to fund operations.\n\n4. **Decline in '評価・換算差額等' (Valuation and Translation Adjustments)**: The '評価・換算差額等' has turned negative, dropping from 754 million yen in the prior year to -178 million yen in the current year. This could indicate losses in foreign exchange or valuation adjustments, which may not have been adequately explained.\n\n5. **Employee Count Increase**: The number of employees has increased significantly from 3,366 in the prior year to 5,575 in the current year. This is a substantial jump and could indicate potential overstaffing or misreporting, especially given the decline in profitability.\n\n6. **Unusual Trends in Fixed Asset Transactions**: The '固定資産売却益' (Gain on Sale of Fixed Assets) has dropped significantly from 8.96 billion yen in the prior year to 834 million yen in the current year. This could indicate a one-time gain in the prior year that inflated profits, or it could suggest a lack of transparency in asset management.\n\n7. **Negative '現金及び現金同等物に係る換算差額' (Translation Adjustments for Cash and Cash Equivalents)**: The translation adjustment for cash and cash equivalents has turned negative, dropping from 84 million yen in the prior year to -293 million yen in the current year. This could indicate foreign exchange losses or other issues that need further explanation.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they suggest potential areas of concern that warrant further investigation, particularly around the company's cash flow management, debt reliance, and significant changes in profitability and employee count."}

However, there are a few points that could raise concerns or warrant further investigation: 1) The significant drop in revenue ('売上高') from the prior year (46.37 billion yen to 40.41 billion yen) is not accompanied by a proportional decrease in costs or expenses, which could indicate potential misclassification or manipulation of expenses. 2) The '特別利益合計' (extraordinary income) is reported as zero in the current year, despite being significant in the prior year (403 million yen). This could be a red flag if the company is attempting to smooth earnings. 3) The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a consistent negative trend, which is typical for companies investing in growth, but the significant reduction in the current year (-1.55 billion yen compared to -2.57 billion yen two years prior) without a clear explanation could indicate potential underreporting of investments. 4) The '自己株式の取得による支出' (expenditure for acquiring treasury stock) increased significantly in the current year (-66 million yen compared to -4 million yen in the prior year), which could be a strategy to manipulate stock prices or earnings per share. 5) The '従業員数' (number of employees) has been decreasing over the years, which could be a sign of cost-cutting measures, but the sharp drop from 1,111 to 1,105 in the current year might require further explanation. While these points are not definitive evidence of fraud, they suggest areas that should be scrutinized further."}

This is a substantial jump, and while it could be due to legitimate reasons, such as improved operational efficiency or one-time gains, it warrants further investigation to ensure the increase is not artificially inflated.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Comprehensive Income**: The '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income) decreased from 896 million yen in the prior year to 778 million yen in the current year, despite the significant increase in net income. This discrepancy could indicate that other components of comprehensive income, such as unrealized gains or losses, are negatively impacting the total. This inconsistency should be examined further.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flow Components**: The '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) decreased from 3,190 million yen in the prior year to 2,784 million yen in the current year, despite the significant increase in net income. This could indicate potential issues with the quality of earnings or aggressive revenue recognition practices.\n\n4. **Reduction in Short-Term Borrowings**: The '短期借入金' (Short-Term Borrowings) decreased significantly from 3,069 million yen in the prior year to 1,725 million yen in the current year. While this could be a sign of improved liquidity, it is worth verifying whether this reduction is supported by operational cash flows or other legitimate sources.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: There are several instances of missing data, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) and '社債発行費、繰延資産' (Bond Issuance Costs, Deferred Assets). While this may be due to the nature of the company's operations or reporting standards, it is important to confirm that these omissions are not attempts to obscure relevant information.\n\n6. **Increase in Depreciation and Impairment Losses**: The '減損損失' (Impairment Losses) increased significantly from 85 million yen in the prior year to 184 million yen in the current year. Additionally, the '減価償却費及び償却費' (Depreciation and Amortization) decreased from 2,119 million yen to 1,626 million yen.

However, there are a few points worth noting that could indicate potential red flags or require further investigation: \n\n1. **Declining Revenue and Profitability**: The company's revenue ('売上高') has been declining consistently over the past few years, with a significant drop from the 'Prior2Year' to the 'CurrentYear'. Similarly, '経常利益' and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' have also decreased. While this could be due to market conditions or other external factors, the consistent decline warrants further scrutiny to ensure there is no manipulation to mask poor performance.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flow Components**: The '貸倒引当金の増減額' (Allowance for doubtful accounts) shows a significant decrease in the 'CurrentYear' compared to the 'Prior1Year'. This could indicate aggressive accounting practices to improve the appearance of financial health. Additionally, the '財務キャッシュフロー' (Financing cash flow) shows a significant outflow in the 'CurrentYear', which could be related to debt repayment or other financial activities. The reasons for these changes should be clarified.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Temporary Employee Numbers**: The '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average temporary employees) has decreased significantly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear'. While this could be due to operational adjustments, it is worth investigating whether this aligns with the company's overall strategy and operations.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The '投資有価証券' (Investment securities) increased significantly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear', while '無形固定資産' (Intangible fixed assets) decreased. This could indicate a shift in investment strategy, but the rationale behind these changes should be examined.\n\n5. **Omission of Certain Data**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted earnings per share) is consistently marked as '－' (not applicable). While this may be valid, it is unusual for a company to not report this metric if there are potential dilutive securities. This omission should be clarified.\n\n6. **Significant Decrease in Long-term Liabilities**: The '長期借入金' (Long-term borrowings) has decreased significantly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear'. While this could indicate debt repayment, it is important to verify whether this aligns with the company's financial strategy and whether the repayment was funded through sustainable means.\n\nOverall, while there are no definitive signs of fraud, the above points suggest areas that require further investigation to rule out potential manipulation or aggressive accounting practices."}

This could indicate potential labor issues, cost-cutting measures, or misreporting of employee data.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Income Discrepancy**: The comprehensive income ('包括利益') for the current year is negative (-321,000,000), despite the company reporting a positive net income attributable to parent company shareholders ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') of 520,000,000. This inconsistency could suggest issues with other comprehensive income components, such as unrealized losses on securities or foreign currency translation adjustments, which are not fully explained.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: There is a significant reduction in the value of intangible fixed assets ('無形固定資産') from 4,020,000,000 in the prior year to 3,035,000,000 in the current year. Additionally, the value of tools, instruments, and fixtures ('工具、器具及び備品') has dropped sharply from 7,903,000,000 to 6,533,000,000. These changes could indicate asset impairments, disposals, or potential misstatements.\n\n4. **Cash Flow from Financing Activities**: The company reports a positive cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') of 206,000,000 in the current year, compared to a negative cash flow of -262,000,000 in the prior year. This is primarily driven by an increase in long-term borrowings ('長期借入れによる収入') and a decrease in repayments. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it could indicate reliance on debt financing, which may warrant further scrutiny.\n\n5. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The company reports a significant increase in special losses ('特別損失合計') from 83,000,000 in the prior year to 967,000,000 in the current year. This is accompanied by a large increase in special gains ('特別利益合計') from 50,000,000 to 403,000,000. The nature of these gains and losses is not fully explained, which could raise questions about their legitimacy or timing.\n\n6. **Unrealized Losses on Securities**: The valuation difference on available-for-sale securities ('その他有価証券評価差額金') has dropped significantly from 857,000,000 in the prior year to 265,000,000 in the current year. This could indicate significant unrealized losses, which may not have been adequately disclosed or explained.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Tax Payments**: The company's corporate tax payments ('法人税等の支払額') have increased significantly from -142,000,000 in the prior year to -304,000,000 in the current year, despite only a moderate increase in pre-tax profit.

While this could be due to genuine operational challenges, the magnitude of the decline is unusual and should be scrutinized.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Cash Flow Trends**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) shows a significant improvement from -240 million yen in the prior year to 72 million yen in the current year, despite the sharp decline in profitability. This inconsistency between cash flow and profitability metrics could indicate potential manipulation of cash flow figures.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The '支払手形及び買掛金' (Accounts Payable) has decreased significantly from 3,698 million yen to 1,672 million yen, while '短期借入金' (Short-term Borrowings) increased from 3,036 million yen to 3,638 million yen. Such large shifts in liabilities without clear explanations could be indicative of efforts to manage financial ratios or liquidity artificially.\n\n4. **Unexplained Adjustments in Provisions**: The '賞与引当金' (Bonus Provisions) increased significantly from 210 million yen to 344 million yen, and the '貸倒引当金' (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) decreased from -24 million yen to -17 million yen. These adjustments could be legitimate but should be explained in detail to rule out manipulation.\n\n5. **Negative Trends in Equity Metrics**: The '１株当たり純資産額' (Net Assets per Share) has increased significantly from 23.26 yen to 68.17 yen, despite the company's net income turning negative. This inconsistency could indicate potential errors or manipulation in equity-related calculations.\n\n6. **Unusual Accounting Entries**: The '特別利益合計' (Extraordinary Income) shows a sudden entry of 157 million yen in the current year, which was zero in the prior year. Similarly, '特別損失合計' (Extraordinary Loss) decreased significantly from 524 million yen to 112 million yen. These entries could be used to smooth earnings or offset operational losses.\n\n7. **Decline in Employee Count**: The number of employees has decreased over the years, from 660 four years ago to 524 in the current year. While this could be due to restructuring, it may also indicate operational challenges that are not fully disclosed.\n\n8. **Unexplained Changes in Depreciation**: The '減価償却費及び償却費' (Depreciation and Amortization) increased from 435 million yen to 481 million yen, despite a decline in fixed assets.

While this could be due to improved cash flow from operations, the increase is unusually large and should be cross-verified with the sources of cash inflows.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Certain Accounts**: The '資本剰余金' (Capital Surplus) increased significantly from 12.0 billion yen to 16.3 billion yen, and '自己株式' (Treasury Stock) decreased from -3.95 billion yen to -0.895 billion yen. These changes could indicate significant equity transactions, such as share buybacks or reissuance, which should be verified for legitimacy.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in '社債' (Corporate Bonds)**: The '社債' account shows a value of 16 million yen in the prior year but is missing ('－') in the current year. This could indicate a redemption or reclassification, but the lack of explanation is a potential red flag.\n\n4. **Environmental Provisions**: The '環境対策引当金' (Environmental Provisions) decreased significantly from 65 million yen to 4 million yen. This could indicate a resolution of environmental liabilities, but the sharp drop should be explained in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n5. **Potentially Missing Data**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) is missing ('－') for most years except the last two. While this may be due to the absence of dilutive securities, it is worth confirming.\n\n6. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from financing activities ('財務キャッシュ・フロー') shows a significant swing from -6.02 billion yen in the prior year to +2.42 billion yen in the current year. This could be due to new borrowings or equity financing, but the details should be reviewed.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further scrutiny.

While this could be due to legitimate business growth, such a sharp increase (almost doubling in some cases) should be scrutinized for potential revenue recognition issues or one-time gains.\n\n2. **Decline in Workforce**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has been steadily declining over the years, with a significant drop in the current year. This is unusual given the sharp increase in profitability and revenue. A declining workforce typically correlates with cost-cutting measures, not significant revenue and profit growth.\n\n3. **Non-Disclosure of Bond Issuance**: In the cash flow statement, the line item '社債の発行による収入' (Proceeds from Bond Issuance) is marked as '－' (missing or not applicable) for the current year, despite the company having issued bonds in the prior year. This could indicate a lack of transparency or incomplete reporting.\n\n4. **Non-Operating Income/Expense Discrepancy**: The '非支配株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests) has shifted from a negative value in the prior year to a positive value in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, the reason for this shift should be clarified, as it could indicate changes in subsidiary performance or ownership structure.\n\n5. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') has more than doubled in the current year, which is inconsistent with the relatively modest increase in revenue.

This is unusual and warrants further investigation, especially since operating profit and cash flow from operations have increased. \n\n2. **Significant Special Losses**: The company recorded a large special loss ('特別損失合計') of 8.735 billion yen in the current year, compared to only 750 million yen in the prior year. This includes a substantial impairment loss ('減損損失') of 7.493 billion yen, which was absent in the prior year. The timing and justification for this impairment should be scrutinized to ensure it is not being used to manipulate earnings. \n\n3. **Reduction in Workforce**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has decreased significantly over the years, from 21,477 four years ago to 18,032 in the current year. While this could be due to operational efficiency, it is worth investigating whether this aligns with the company's growth in revenue and operations. \n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Retained Earnings**: The retained earnings ('利益剰余金') have decreased from 230.3 billion yen to 227.3 billion yen, despite the company being profitable. This could indicate higher dividend payouts or other distributions, but it should be verified. \n\n5. **High Exchange Rate Gains**: The company has reported significant foreign exchange gains ('為替差益') in both the prior year and the current year. While this is not inherently suspicious, it is worth confirming that these gains are legitimate and not being used to inflate profits. \n\n6. **Large Increase in Tax Expenses**: The company's tax expenses ('法人税、住民税及び事業税') have increased significantly, from 7.62 billion yen to 10.67 billion yen, despite a decline in pre-tax profit ('税引前利益'). This discrepancy should be explained. \n\n7. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from operating activities ('営業キャッシュフロー') has increased significantly, while cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has become more negative.

While this could be due to legitimate business challenges, such a sharp decline should be explained in the report, especially when sales revenue ('売上高') increased significantly during the same period.\n\n2. **Discrepancy Between Pre-Tax Profit and Net Income**: The '税引前利益' (pre-tax profit) decreased from 170,032 million yen to 120,593 million yen, a decline of about 29%, which is less severe than the decline in net income. This suggests that factors other than operational performance, such as tax or extraordinary items, may have disproportionately impacted net income. However, no clear explanation is provided.\n\n3. **Unusual Increase in Non-Controlling Interests Loss**: The '非支配株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to non-controlling interests) shows a significant increase in losses, from -103 million yen in the prior year to -1,282 million yen in the current year. This is an unusual trend and should be clarified, as it could indicate potential misallocation of profits or losses.\n\n4. **Sharp Increase in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)**: The '販売費及び一般管理費' (SG&A expenses) increased from 154,940 million yen to 231,783 million yen, a rise of approximately 50%. This is disproportionate to the increase in sales revenue (approximately 17%) and should be explained, as it could indicate misclassification of expenses or inflated costs.\n\n5. **Contradictory Trends in Cash Flows and Profitability**: Despite the significant decline in net income, operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') increased from 94,994 million yen to 143,485 million yen. This discrepancy between cash flow and profitability could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or manipulation of working capital accounts.\n\n6. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company issued 120,000 million yen in bonds ('社債の発行による収入') in the current year, while also redeeming 135,000 million yen in bonds ('社債の償還による支出'). The net effect of these activities is a significant outflow, which is unusual unless the company is restructuring its debt.

The report does not provide details on whether the bonds were redeemed, converted, or otherwise settled. \n3. The '繰延ヘッジ損益' (Deferred Hedge Gains/Losses) is reported as '－' in the current year, whereas it was a small positive value in the prior year. This sudden disappearance of hedge-related items could indicate a change in accounting treatment or hedging strategy, which should be explained. \n4. The '投資有価証券売却益' (Gain on Sale of Investment Securities) appears for the first time in the current year, contributing to '特別利益合計' (Total Extraordinary Gains). While this is not inherently fraudulent, the timing and rationale for the sale should be reviewed to ensure it is not being used to artificially inflate profits. \n5. The '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) has increased significantly in the current year. This could indicate issues with asset valuation or a change in accounting estimates.

While this could be due to genuine business challenges, the magnitude of the decline (e.g., net income dropping from 5.68 billion yen to 524 million yen) is notable and should be explained in the report.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flows**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) has decreased drastically from 9.09 billion yen in the prior year to 2.08 billion yen in the current year. This is inconsistent with the relatively smaller decline in revenue. Additionally, the '現金及び現金同等物に係る換算差額' (translation adjustment for cash and cash equivalents) shows a large negative value (-716 million yen) in the current year, which is a sharp reversal from the prior year's positive value (351 million yen).

This is an unusually high PER, especially given the company's declining profitability, and could indicate market overvaluation or manipulation.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Trends in Key Metrics**: The '自己資本利益率' (return on equity) has dropped significantly from 0.282 in the prior year to 0.024 in the current year, despite an increase in the '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) from 0.566 to 0.601. This inconsistency suggests that the company's equity is not being effectively utilized to generate returns.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities and Equity**: The '流動負債' (current liabilities) and '非流動負債' (non-current liabilities) have both decreased significantly, while '純資産' (net assets) has also declined. This could indicate aggressive debt repayment or asset write-offs, which should be explained in the report.\n\n6. **Potential Issues with Employee Numbers**: The '従業員数' (number of employees) has fluctuated over the years, with a notable drop in the prior years and a slight increase in the current year. While this could be due to restructuring, it is worth investigating whether the reported employee numbers are accurate and consistent with the company's operations.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share) is missing for several years ('－'), which could indicate a lack of transparency or issues with the calculation of diluted EPS.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further investigation. The significant declines in profitability and cash flows, coupled with unusual changes in liabilities, equity, and PER, suggest the possibility of financial manipulation or misrepresentation."}
{"edinet_code": "E02075", "doc_id": "S1009BWI", "label": 0, "prob": 0.8, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report contains several red flags that could indicate potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation. Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Unusual Increase in Equity Despite Losses**: The company's net assets ('純資産額') have increased significantly from 240,754,000 yen in the prior year to 686,369,000 yen in the current year, despite reporting consistent and significant losses ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' and '包括利益'). This is counterintuitive and raises questions about the source of the increase in equity. The increase in '資本金' and '資本剰余金' suggests a potential capital injection, but the details of this are unclear and should be verified.\n\n2. **Significant Changes in Liabilities**: The company's liabilities ('負債') have decreased dramatically from 927,329,000 yen in the prior year to 553,707,000 yen in the current year. This is a substantial reduction and could indicate debt forgiveness, repayment, or reclassification. However, the absence of corresponding cash outflows in the cash flow statement ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') raises questions about how this reduction was achieved.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a significant inflow of 626,522,000 yen in the current year, which is unusually high compared to prior years. This could be related to the increase in equity, but the lack of detailed disclosure about the source of these funds is concerning.\n\n4. **Declining Revenue and Profitability**: The company's revenue ('売上高') has been declining consistently over the past five years, and the current year's revenue is significantly lower than the prior year. Coupled with consistent operating losses ('営業利益') and net losses, this indicates a deteriorating financial position. The company's ability to continue as a going concern should be evaluated.\n\n5. **Unusual Asset Movements**: The balance sheet shows a significant increase in '無形固定資産' (intangible fixed assets) from 6,923,000 yen in the prior year to 28,403,000 yen in the current year. This is a substantial increase and should be scrutinized to ensure that the valuation and recognition of these assets are appropriate.\n\n6. **Employee Count Decline**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has decreased significantly from 111 in the prior year to 103 in the current year, and even more drastically over the past five years. This could indicate operational downsizing, but it also raises questions about the company's ability to sustain operations.\n\n7. **Lack of Disclosure on Key Metrics**: Several key financial metrics, such as '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio) and '自己資本利益率' (return on equity), are not disclosed ('－'). While this may be due to the company's consistent losses, the lack of transparency is concerning.\n\n8. **Unusual Accounting Practices**: The report includes several instances of missing or unusual data, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share) being consistently not disclosed ('－'). While this may be due to the company's financial position, it raises questions about the completeness and accuracy of the report.\n\nOverall, the combination of these factors suggests a higher-than-normal risk of financial misrepresentation or fraud. While some of these issues may have legitimate explanations, the lack of transparency and the presence of multiple red flags warrant further investigation."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Unusual Fluctuations in Profitability**: The company's '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) shows a significant drop from 4,086 million yen in the prior year to just 47 million yen in the current year, despite an increase in '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit) from 3,754 million yen to 5,899 million yen. This discrepancy is unusual and warrants further investigation into the factors causing such a drastic reduction in net income.\n\n2. **High '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)**: The P/E ratio for the current year is reported as 663.8, which is extremely high and suggests that the company's stock price is disproportionately high relative to its earnings. This could indicate overvaluation or manipulation of stock prices.\n\n3. **Significant '特別損失' (Extraordinary Losses)**: The extraordinary losses have increased significantly from 2,112 million yen in the prior year to 6,974 million yen in the current year. This includes a large '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) of 5,174 million yen, which is more than triple the prior year's figure. The reasons for these losses should be scrutinized to ensure they are legitimate and not artificially inflated to reduce taxable income.\n\n4. **Decline in '純資産' (Net Assets)**: The company's net assets have decreased from 31,217 million yen in the prior year to 27,203 million yen in the current year, despite reporting a positive net income. This decline could indicate issues with asset valuation or undisclosed liabilities.\n\n5. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: While the company reports an increase in '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) from 3,677 million yen to 7,199 million yen, its '現金及び現金同等物の増減額' (Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents) is negative, decreasing by 2,857 million yen. This suggests that cash outflows from investing and financing activities are significantly outweighing inflows, which could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n6. **Reduction in '従業員数' (Number of Employees)**: The number of employees has decreased from 6,760 in the prior year to 6,436 in the current year, which could be a sign of cost-cutting measures or operational downsizing. While not inherently fraudulent, this trend should be analyzed in the context of the company's overall financial health.\n\n7. **Omission of '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted EPS)**: The report does not provide diluted EPS for the current year, which could obscure the impact of potential dilution on shareholder value.\n\n8. **Unusual Changes in '評価・換算差額等' (Valuation and Translation Adjustments)**: The valuation and translation adjustments have shifted from a positive 2,367 million yen in the prior year to a negative 1,674 million yen in the current year. This significant change could indicate issues with foreign exchange or asset revaluation.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Significant Turnaround in Profitability**: The company reported a massive turnaround in profitability, with a net loss of -9.66 billion yen in the prior year to a net profit of 4.08 billion yen in the current year. While such turnarounds are possible, the magnitude of the change warrants scrutiny, especially given the relatively modest increase in sales (from 153.89 billion yen to 168.63 billion yen).\n\n2. **Unusual Special Gains**: The company reported a significant increase in special gains (特別利益) in the current year, primarily driven by the sale of investment securities (投資有価証券売却益). This could be a one-time event used to inflate profits artificially. The reliance on non-operating income to boost profitability is a potential red flag.\n\n3. **Decline in Operating Cash Flow**: Despite the reported profitability, the operating cash flow dropped significantly from 19.54 billion yen in the prior year to 3.68 billion yen in the current year. This discrepancy between reported profits and cash flow could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting manipulations.\n\n4. **Reduction in Liabilities**: The company significantly reduced its liabilities, particularly long-term debt and bonds payable. While this could be a positive sign, the source of funds for such reductions is unclear, especially given the decline in operating cash flow and the reported net loss in the prior year.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Financial Ratios**: The company's return on equity (ROE) jumped from negative or negligible levels in prior years to 16.2% in the current year. Such a dramatic improvement in financial performance is unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\n6. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The company reported a negative adjustment for corporate taxes (法人税等調整額) in the current year, which contributed to the lower tax expense. This could indicate the use of deferred tax assets or other tax strategies to reduce the tax burden artificially.\n\n7. **Decline in Temporary Employees**: The average number of temporary employees decreased from 2,268 in the prior year to 2,102 in the current year, despite the increase in sales. This could indicate cost-cutting measures, but it may also suggest understaffing or other operational issues.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}

This could indicate increasing reliance on debt, which may not align with the company's improving profitability metrics such as '経常利益' (ordinary profit) and '当期純利益' (net income). \n\n2. **Discrepancy in Employee Data**: The '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) shows a significant drop from 446 in the prior year to 235 in the current year, despite an increase in total employees ('従業員数'). This inconsistency could suggest potential misreporting or a lack of clarity in employee classification.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Concerns**: While the company reports a significant increase in '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities), its '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) remains deeply negative, and '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) has dropped significantly compared to the prior year. This could indicate potential liquidity management issues or aggressive investment strategies that may not be sustainable.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: The '仕入債務の増減額' (change in accounts payable) shows a significant negative swing from a positive 94,464,000 yen in the prior year to a negative 1,165,573,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate potential issues with supplier payments or changes in payment terms.\n\n5. **Lack of Disclosure on Diluted EPS**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) is not disclosed for any of the years. While this may be due to the absence of dilutive securities, the lack of explanation raises questions about transparency.\n\n6. **Significant Increase in '評価・換算差額等' (valuation and translation adjustments)**: The '評価・換算差額等' has increased significantly from 2,659,800,000 yen in the prior year to 4,553,357,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate reliance on unrealized gains, which may not be sustainable.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas where further scrutiny is necessary to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **Unusual Fluctuations in Key Metrics**:\n   - The company's '売上高' (sales revenue) has grown significantly over the years, from 58.4 billion yen (Prior4Year) to 164.2 billion yen (CurrentYear). However, the '経常利益' (ordinary profit) and '包括利益' (comprehensive income) do not show a proportional increase, with '包括利益' even turning negative in the CurrentYear (-2.05 billion yen). This discrepancy could indicate issues with cost management, revenue recognition, or other operational inefficiencies.\n\n2. **Negative Comprehensive Income**:\n   - The '包括利益' (comprehensive income) is negative in both the CurrentYear and Prior3Year, despite positive '当期純利益' (net income) in the CurrentYear. This could be due to unrealized losses or other adjustments, but the lack of detailed explanation raises concerns about transparency.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**:\n   - The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) shows a significant increase in the CurrentYear (11.8 billion yen) compared to Prior1Year (1.39 billion yen). This sharp rise is not fully explained by the reported profits or other operational metrics, which could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting maneuvers.\n   - The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) shows a large outflow in the CurrentYear (-7.47 billion yen), primarily due to long-term debt repayments. However, the company also issued significant long-term debt (15.77 billion yen), raising questions about the sustainability of its financing strategy.\n\n4. **Decline in Equity Metrics**:\n   - The '純資産額' (net assets) decreased from 39.18 billion yen (Prior1Year) to 37.34 billion yen (CurrentYear), despite positive net income. This decline is partially due to a reduction in '利益剰余金' (retained earnings), which dropped significantly from 8.89 billion yen to 4.52 billion yen. The reasons for this drop are unclear and could indicate issues such as excessive dividend payouts or hidden losses.\n\n5. **High '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)**:\n   - The '株価収益率' (P/E ratio) is extremely high in the CurrentYear (88.3), which could indicate overvaluation of the company's stock or low investor confidence in its earnings quality.\n\n6. **Employee Count Anomaly**:\n   - The number of employees ('従業員数') increased significantly from 2,372 (Prior4Year) to 6,695 (CurrentYear). While this could be due to business expansion, the corresponding increase in '売上高' (sales revenue) does not seem to translate into proportional profit growth, raising questions about operational efficiency.\n\n7. **Unusual Items in Financial Statements**:\n   - The '特別利益合計' (extraordinary income) and '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) show significant fluctuations, with a sharp drop in extraordinary income in the CurrentYear (496 million yen) compared to Prior1Year (2.91 billion yen). This could indicate one-time gains or losses being used to manipulate earnings.\n   - The '繰延ヘッジ損益' (deferred hedge gains/losses) is negative (-122 million yen) in the CurrentYear, but there is no corresponding entry in Prior1Year. This sudden appearance raises questions about the company's hedging activities and their impact on financial results.\n\n8. **Lack of Detailed Explanations**:\n   - Several key metrics, such as the sharp increase in operating cash flow and the decline in retained earnings, are not accompanied by detailed explanations in the report. This lack of transparency could be a red flag for potential misrepresentation or omission of material information.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation, particularly around revenue recognition, cost management, and cash flow reporting."}

This is a significant swing and is not adequately explained in the report. \n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flows**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) increased significantly from 11.83 billion yen to 19.54 billion yen, while '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) and '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) show inconsistent patterns. For example, the financing cash flow turned positive (1.4 billion yen) after being negative (-7.47 billion yen) in the prior year, which is unusual given the company's worsening financial performance.\n\n3. **Decline in Equity and Asset Quality**: The '純資産額' (Net Assets) dropped significantly from 37.34 billion yen to 22.25 billion yen, and the '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio) fell from 23.3% to 14.4%. This indicates a deterioration in the company's financial stability. Additionally, the '利益剰余金' (Retained Earnings) turned negative, which is concerning.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Employee Numbers**: The '従業員数' (Number of Employees) increased steadily, but the '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) also increased disproportionately. This could indicate potential manipulation of labor costs or misreporting of employee data.\n\n5. **Unexplained Losses and Write-offs**: The report mentions a '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) of 6.7 billion yen in the current year, which was not present in the prior year. This is a significant amount and should be explained in detail, as it could be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n6. **Unusual Changes in Borrowings**: The '短期借入金' (Short-term Borrowings) increased significantly from 3.33 billion yen to 12.62 billion yen, while '長期借入金' (Long-term Borrowings) decreased. This shift in borrowing strategy is unusual and could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n7. **Discrepancies in Asset and Liability Accounts**: There are inconsistencies in the reported values of certain accounts, such as '現金及び預金' (Cash and Deposits) and '現金及び現金同等物' (Cash and Cash Equivalents), which do not align perfectly with the cash flow statement. This could indicate potential errors or intentional misstatements.\n\n8. **Unusual Foreign Exchange Adjustments**: The '為替換算調整勘定' (Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments) turned negative (-3.57 billion yen) from a positive 1.19 billion yen in the prior year. This is a significant swing and should be explained, as it could be used to manipulate comprehensive income.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the logical inconsistencies, unexplained losses, and unusual changes in key financial metrics suggest a higher probability of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices."}

This is unusual given that the net income attributable to the parent company (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益) has increased. A negative comprehensive income despite positive net income could indicate unreported or understated losses in other comprehensive income components, such as foreign currency translation adjustments or unrealized losses on securities.\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments (為替換算調整勘定)**: The foreign currency translation adjustments have shifted from a positive value (302,964,000) in the prior year to a negative value (-512,876,000) in the current year. This is a significant swing and could indicate potential manipulation or misrepresentation of foreign exchange impacts.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow (営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) has increased significantly from 3,568,737,000 to 5,254,504,000, while the net income attributable to the parent company has only moderately increased. This discrepancy could suggest aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting practices to inflate cash flow.\n\n4. **Decline in Equity Ratio (自己資本比率)**: The equity ratio has been steadily declining over the years, from 55.6% four years ago to 41.9% in the current year. While this could be due to legitimate reasons, it raises concerns about the company's financial stability and whether liabilities are being understated.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Temporary Employees (平均臨時雇用人員)**: The number of temporary employees has decreased significantly from 235 in the prior year to 190 in the current year, despite an increase in total employees. This could indicate potential misclassification of employees or cost-cutting measures that are not fully disclosed.\n\n6. **Significant Changes in Other Comprehensive Income Components**: The valuation difference on available-for-sale securities (その他有価証券評価差額金) has decreased significantly from 4,502,743,000 to 3,484,503,000. This could indicate potential losses or impairments that are not fully explained.\n\n7. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The financial cash flow (財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) has turned negative (-1,006,226,000) in the current year, compared to a positive figure in the prior year.

This is accompanied by a negative '包括利益' (comprehensive income) and a sharp decline in '自己資本利益率' (ROE) to -0.089. While this could be due to genuine operational challenges, the magnitude of the decline warrants scrutiny.\n\n2. **Unusual Increase in Special Losses**: The '特別損失合計' (total extraordinary losses) increased significantly from 7.31 billion yen in the prior year to 14.71 billion yen in the current year. This includes a notable increase in impairment losses ('減損損失'). The reasons for these extraordinary losses should be investigated further to ensure they are legitimate and not used to manipulate earnings.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) dropped sharply from 25.45 billion yen in the prior year to 5.47 billion yen in the current year, despite a relatively stable '経常利益' (ordinary income). This could indicate issues with working capital management or potential misrepresentation of cash flows.\n\n4. **Increase in Debt**: The company significantly increased its short-term and long-term borrowings ('短期借入金' and '長期借入金'), with long-term borrowings rising from 95.93 billion yen to 104.01 billion yen. This increase in debt, coupled with declining profitability, raises concerns about the company's financial stability.\n\n5. **Inventory Management**: There is a notable increase in '原材料及び貯蔵品' (raw materials and supplies) and '仕掛品' (work-in-progress inventory), while '商品及び製品' (finished goods) decreased. This could indicate potential overproduction or issues with inventory turnover, which may be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n6. **Unusual Gains from Investment Securities**: The company reported a significant gain from the sale of investment securities ('投資有価証券売却益') in the current year (3.74 billion yen), compared to only 60 million yen in the prior year. This could be a one-time event used to offset operational losses.\n\n7. **Decline in Shareholder Equity**: The '純資産' (net assets) decreased significantly from 93.3 billion yen to 83.2 billion yen, driven by a decline in '利益剰余金' (retained earnings). This reflects the company's poor financial performance and raises concerns about its ability to sustain operations.\n\n8. **Negative Trends in Key Ratios**: The '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) declined from 0.237 to 0.201, indicating increased financial leverage. Additionally, the '株価収益率' (P/E ratio) is not reported for the current year, likely due to the net loss, which could signal investor concerns.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation.

This could indicate potential issues with foreign currency transactions or hedging strategies, which may require further investigation.\n2. The '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) has decreased significantly from 69,265,000,000 yen in the prior year to 49,593,000,000 yen in the current year, despite an increase in '売上高' (Revenue) and '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit). This discrepancy could suggest issues with cash collection, changes in working capital, or potential manipulation of revenue recognition.\n3. The '現金及び現金同等物の増減額' (Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents) shows a large negative value of -23,370,000,000 yen in the current year compared to a positive value of 3,308,000,000 yen in the prior year. This significant drop in cash reserves warrants further analysis to understand the underlying causes.\n4. The '従業員数' (Number of Employees) has been steadily decreasing over the years, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) has increased significantly in the current year. This shift in workforce composition could indicate cost-cutting measures or potential labor-related issues.\n5. The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) is consistently marked as '－' (not applicable) across all years. While this may be valid, it is unusual for a company to not report diluted earnings per share if there are potential dilutive securities, and this should be clarified.\n6. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) remains consistently negative, which is typical for many companies, but the large and sustained outflows could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or investments that may not be yielding expected returns.\n7. The '短期借入金' (Short-Term Borrowings) has decreased significantly from 7,571,000,000 yen in the prior year to 602,000,000 yen in the current year.

This is accompanied by a sharp drop in comprehensive income ('包括利益') from 5.2 billion yen to -2.01 billion yen. Such a steep decline in profitability warrants further investigation, especially since the revenue ('売上高') only declined by about 6.6% year-over-year.\n\n2. **Unusual Increase in Short-Term Borrowings**: The short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') have increased significantly from 13.56 billion yen to 26.83 billion yen, while long-term borrowings ('長期借入金') have decreased from 10.49 billion yen to 4.39 billion yen. This shift in debt structure could indicate liquidity issues or an attempt to manage financial ratios artificially.\n\n3. **High Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER)**: The company's price-to-earnings ratio ('株価収益率') has surged to 90.4 in the current year from 21.1 in the prior year. This is unusually high and could indicate overvaluation or market speculation, especially given the significant decline in earnings.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has decreased significantly from 14.51 billion yen to 7.94 billion yen, while the company has reported a positive financing cash flow ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') of 1.99 billion yen, reversing a negative trend from the prior year. This could suggest reliance on external financing to cover operational shortfalls.\n\n5. **Inventory Build-Up**: Inventory levels ('棚卸資産') have increased significantly, as seen in the cash flow statement ('棚卸資産の増減額（△は増加）') where there is a 5.18 billion yen increase in inventory. This could indicate overproduction, declining sales, or potential issues with inventory management.\n\n6. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The company reported a gain from the sale of investment securities ('投資有価証券売却益') of 572 million yen in the current year, which was absent in the prior year. This could be a one-time event used to offset declining operational performance. Additionally, the absence of impairment losses ('減損損失') in the current year, compared to 2.77 billion yen in the prior year, could indicate delayed recognition of asset impairments.\n\n7. **Decline in Equity and Asset Quality**: The company's equity ('純資産') has decreased from 71.15 billion yen to 64.66 billion yen, and the equity ratio ('自己資本比率') has dropped from 43.1% to 39.0%. This indicates a weakening financial position.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise concerns about the company's financial health and transparency. The combination of declining profitability, unusual debt restructuring, and reliance on one-time gains warrants further scrutiny."}

Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Unusual Fluctuations in Key Metrics**:\n   - The '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net income attributable to parent company shareholders) shows a dramatic drop from 1,051 million yen (Prior2Year) to just 1 million yen (Prior1Year), followed by a significant recovery to 531 million yen (CurrentYear). Such extreme fluctuations warrant further investigation, as they may indicate earnings manipulation or one-time adjustments.\n   - The '包括利益' (Comprehensive income) also shows erratic behavior, with a large negative value (-1,667 million yen in Prior2Year) followed by a small positive value (19 million yen in Prior1Year) and then a recovery to 111 million yen in the CurrentYear. This inconsistency could indicate issues with the recognition of gains or losses.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Per-Share Metrics**:\n   - The '１株当たり純資産額' (Net assets per share) jumps significantly from 3368.18 yen (Prior1Year) to 3482.43 yen (CurrentYear). This is unusual given the decline in total net assets ('純資産額') and the increase in treasury stock ('自己株式').\n   - The '１株当たり当期純利益又は当期純損失' (Earnings per share) also shows a dramatic increase from 0.17 yen (Prior1Year) to 59.61 yen (CurrentYear), which is inconsistent with the relatively modest recovery in net income.\n\n3. **Treasury Stock Acquisition**:\n   - The '自己株式' (Treasury stock) increased significantly from -171 million yen (Prior1Year) to -2,492 million yen (CurrentYear). This large acquisition of treasury stock could be an attempt to manipulate earnings per share or other financial ratios.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**:\n   - The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash flow from operating activities) remains strong and increasing, despite declining sales ('売上高') and net income. This could indicate aggressive working capital management or potential manipulation of cash flow figures.\n   - The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash flow from investing activities) shows a significant improvement (less negative) in the CurrentYear, which is inconsistent with the decline in fixed assets ('固定資産').\n\n5. **Special Items and Adjustments**:\n   - The '特別利益合計' (Total extraordinary income) dropped significantly from 557 million yen (Prior1Year) to 274 million yen (CurrentYear), while '特別損失合計' (Total extraordinary losses) also decreased from 980 million yen to 106 million yen. These changes could indicate selective recognition of extraordinary items to smooth earnings.\n   - The '負ののれん発生益' (Negative goodwill) was recognized in Prior1Year but not in the CurrentYear, which could have been used to inflate prior earnings.\n\n6. **Declining Employee Numbers**:\n   - The number of employees ('従業員数') has been steadily declining over the years, which is consistent with the declining sales. However, the increase in '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average temporary employees) in the CurrentYear could indicate an attempt to reduce costs artificially.\n\n7. **Audit Verification**:\n   - While the report has been verified by a certified public accountant, this does not rule out the possibility of fraud, as auditors may not always detect sophisticated manipulation.\n\nBased on these observations, there are several red flags that warrant further investigation. However, the evidence is not conclusive enough to definitively label the report as fraudulent."}

However, there are a few potential red flags that warrant further investigation: \n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow (CF)**: The operating cash flow has turned negative in the current year (-460,000,000) despite an increase in revenue and net income. This is unusual and could indicate issues with working capital management or potential manipulation of cash flow items. For example, the significant increase in accounts receivable (-1,321,000,000) and inventory (-1,763,000,000) suggests aggressive revenue recognition or overstocking, which could be a sign of earnings management.\n\n2. **Self-Stock Acquisition**: The company has spent a significant amount (-865,000,000) on acquiring its own shares in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it could be used to artificially inflate earnings per share (EPS) or manipulate stock prices.\n\n3. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The company reported a gain from the sale of fixed assets (101,000,000) and a loss from investment securities (-8,000,000) in the current year. While these are disclosed, the timing and nature of these transactions should be reviewed to ensure they are not being used to smooth earnings.\n\n4. **Decline in Comprehensive Income**: Comprehensive income has decreased in the current year (1,454,000,000) compared to the prior year (1,682,000,000), despite an increase in net income. This discrepancy could indicate unrealized losses or other adjustments that are not fully transparent.\n\n5. **Increase in Short-Term Borrowings**: The company has significantly increased its short-term borrowings (1,332,000,000), which could indicate liquidity issues or reliance on debt to fund operations.\n\n6. **Negative Trends in Key Ratios**: The self-capital ratio (0.498) and return on equity (0.102) have slightly declined compared to the prior year, which could indicate weakening financial health.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further scrutiny. The negative operating cash flow, in particular, is a significant concern given the company's reported profitability."}

Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Unusual Fluctuations in Key Metrics**:\n   - The company's '売上高' (sales revenue) dropped significantly in the Prior1Year (from 78.4 billion yen to 58.1 billion yen) and then rebounded sharply in the CurrentYear to 84.8 billion yen. While fluctuations can occur, such a sharp recovery in a single year without a clear explanation could be a red flag.\n   - Similarly, '経常利益' (ordinary profit) and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders) show a dramatic increase in the CurrentYear compared to Prior1Year. This could indicate potential earnings management.\n\n2. **Discrepancies in Accounts Receivable**:\n   - In the balance sheet (bs), '受取手形及び売掛金' (notes and accounts receivable) is missing for the CurrentYear, while '売掛金' (accounts receivable) is reported separately as 8.04 billion yen. This inconsistency in reporting could indicate an attempt to obscure details about receivables.\n\n3. **Inventory and Accounts Payable Movements**:\n   - The cash flow statement (cf) shows a significant increase in '仕入債務の増減額' (accounts payable changes) in the CurrentYear (10.85 billion yen increase) compared to a large decrease in the Prior1Year (-12.9 billion yen). This could suggest manipulation of working capital to inflate cash flow.\n   - Similarly, '棚卸資産の増減額' (inventory changes) shows a large increase in the CurrentYear (-3.55 billion yen) compared to a decrease in the Prior1Year (1.51 billion yen). This could indicate potential overstatement of inventory or underreporting of cost of goods sold.\n\n4. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - The cash flow from investing activities (cf) shows a significant positive inflow in the Prior1Year (29.6 billion yen) followed by a much smaller inflow in the CurrentYear (8.88 billion yen). The Prior1Year inflow is unusually high and may require further explanation, especially given the lack of significant asset sales in the income statement.\n\n5. **Employee Count Decline**:\n   - The number of employees has decreased steadily over the years, with a notable drop in the CurrentYear (from 964 to 906). This is inconsistent with the sharp increase in sales and profits, as one would expect a growing workforce to support such growth.\n\n6. **Self-Stock Acquisition**:\n   - The company reported a significant outflow for '自己株式の取得による支出' (purchase of treasury stock) in the CurrentYear (-9.24 billion yen). While not inherently fraudulent, this could be a strategy to manipulate earnings per share (EPS).\n\n7. **Unusual Gains from Asset Sales**:\n   - The income statement (pl) shows a large '投資有価証券売却益' (gain on sale of investment securities) in the CurrentYear (3.07 billion yen) compared to the Prior1Year (290 million yen). This could indicate reliance on non-operating income to boost profits.\n\n8. **Missing or Inconsistent Data**:\n   - Several data points are missing or represented as '－', such as '受取手形及び売掛金' (notes and accounts receivable) and '建設仮勘定' (construction in progress). While this could be due to parsing errors, it raises questions about the completeness and transparency of the report.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, the above points suggest potential red flags that could indicate earnings management or other irregularities.

While this could be due to legitimate operational improvements, such a drastic change warrants further scrutiny to ensure it is not artificially manipulated.\n\n2. **Investment Cash Flow (投資キャッシュフロー)**: The investment cash flow turned positive in the current year (158 million yen) after being negative for several years. This is primarily due to the sale of investment securities (投資有価証券の売却による収入) amounting to 320 million yen. The timing and rationale for this sale should be examined to ensure it aligns with the company's strategy and is not an attempt to inflate cash flow artificially.\n\n3. **Significant Reduction in Short-Term Borrowings (短期借入金)**: The short-term borrowings decreased significantly from 2.999 billion yen in the prior year to 1.13 billion yen in the current year. While this could indicate improved liquidity, it is worth investigating whether this reduction is sustainable or if it was achieved through unusual or non-recurring means.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Accounts Receivable and Payable**: The accounts receivable (売上債権) increased significantly in the prior year (-1.321 billion yen) and then decreased by 1.808 billion yen in the current year. Similarly, accounts payable (仕入債務) increased by 942 million yen in the prior year but decreased by 638 million yen in the current year. These fluctuations could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or changes in payment terms with suppliers and customers, which should be investigated further.\n\n5. **Lack of Diluted Earnings Per Share (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益)**: The report consistently shows '－' for diluted earnings per share, which could indicate the absence of convertible securities or other dilutive instruments. While this is not inherently suspicious, it is worth confirming that this is accurate and not an omission.\n\n6. **Significant Decrease in Other Comprehensive Income (包括利益)**: Other comprehensive income decreased from 1.477 billion yen in the prior year to 1.521 billion yen in the current year, despite an increase in net income. This could indicate unrealized losses or other adjustments that should be reviewed.\n\n7. **Unusual Gains from Investment Securities (投資有価証券売却益)**: The company reported a gain of 180 million yen from the sale of investment securities in the current year, compared to no such gains in the prior year. The timing and necessity of this sale should be examined to ensure it aligns with the company's financial strategy.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to rule out any potential manipulation or misrepresentation."}

The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a significant outflow increase from -13.113 billion yen in the prior year to -18.267 billion yen in the current year.

However, there are some potential red flags that could suggest the need for further investigation: \n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow Volatility**: The operating cash flow has shown significant volatility over the years, with a large negative value four years ago (-5.89 billion yen), a small positive value last year (1.16 billion yen), and a sharp increase to 7 billion yen in the current year. While this could be due to legitimate operational improvements, such volatility warrants closer scrutiny to ensure it is not the result of aggressive revenue recognition or other manipulative practices.\n\n2. **Short-Term Borrowing Reduction**: The short-term borrowings have decreased significantly from 11.015 billion yen in the prior year to 5.992 billion yen in the current year. This could indicate a shift in the company's financing strategy, but the reason for such a large reduction should be clarified, especially since long-term borrowings have increased.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Provisions**: The allowance for doubtful accounts has increased significantly (from -46 million yen to -100 million yen), and the provision for bonuses has decreased (from 1.709 billion yen to 1.562 billion yen). These changes could be legitimate but should be examined to ensure they are not being used to manipulate earnings.\n\n4. **Non-Recurring Items**: The company has reported a gain from the sale of investment securities (25 million yen) and a special loss from the valuation of investment securities (22 million yen).

However, there are several logical and operational red flags that could suggest potential issues or risks of fraudulent activities: \n\n1. **Declining Financial Health**: The company's financial health has been deteriorating significantly over the years. For example, the '純資産額' (Net Assets) has dropped from 897,874,000 yen two years ago to 264,389,000 yen in the current year. Similarly, the '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio) has fallen from 0.361 to 0.172, indicating a weakening capital structure. While this alone does not indicate fraud, it raises concerns about the company's sustainability and potential pressure to manipulate financial results.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Employee Trends**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has fluctuated significantly, from 93 four years ago to 50 in the current year, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) has also decreased from 1,597 to 592. Such drastic changes in workforce size could indicate operational instability or attempts to reduce costs aggressively, which might mask underlying issues.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) has been highly volatile, with a positive figure of 47,867,000 yen in the prior year turning into a significant negative figure of -225,599,000 yen in the current year. This inconsistency could suggest potential mismanagement or manipulation of cash flow reporting.\n\n4. **Unexplained Changes in Key Accounts**: Certain accounts, such as '貸倒引当金' (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts), show significant reductions (e.g., from -24,306,000 yen to -15,058,000 yen), which could indicate aggressive accounting practices to improve the appearance of financial health. Similarly, the '賞与引当金' (Bonus Reserve) has been completely removed in the current year, which is unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\n5. **Lack of Transparency in Key Metrics**: Several key metrics, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) and '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio), are consistently marked as '－' (not disclosed). While this might be due to the company's financial losses, the lack of disclosure reduces transparency and could be a red flag.\n\n6. **Significant Losses and Asset Write-Downs**: The company has reported consistent losses over the years, with '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) worsening from -150,833,000 yen to -482,623,000 yen. Additionally, the '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) has increased significantly, from 20,341,000 yen to 79,559,000 yen, indicating potential overstatement of asset values in prior periods.\n\n7. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) shows a significant reduction in long-term borrowings and other financing activities, which could indicate difficulty in securing external funding. This might pressure the company to manipulate financial results to appear more creditworthy.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation.

Additionally, the company has reported a net loss in three of the last five years, with the current year's loss being particularly large (-1.12 billion yen). This trend raises concerns about the company's financial health and sustainability.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow has turned negative in the current year (-630 million yen) after being positive in the prior year (875 million yen). This is coupled with a significant increase in financing cash flow (1.215 billion yen), primarily due to long-term borrowing (3 billion yen). The reliance on borrowing to sustain operations could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The company's long-term borrowings have more than doubled (from 1.525 billion yen to 3.275 billion yen), and short-term borrowings have appeared for the first time (40 million yen). This sudden increase in debt could be a sign of financial distress.\n\n4. **Decline in Equity**: The company's retained earnings have decreased significantly (from 24.13 billion yen to 22.73 billion yen), and treasury stock has increased (from -570 million yen to -646 million yen). These changes suggest that the company is using its equity to cover losses or fund operations, which could erode shareholder value.\n\n5. **Discrepancies in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees has been steadily declining over the years (from 911 to 881), along with a sharper decline in temporary employees (from 452 to 374). This could indicate cost-cutting measures or operational downsizing, which may not align with the company's long-term growth strategy.\n\n6. **Unusual Asset Movements**: There is a notable increase in raw materials and inventory (from 33 million yen to 123 million yen), which could indicate overstocking or mismanagement of inventory. Additionally, the sale of fixed assets has dropped significantly (from 627 million yen to 4 million yen), which could suggest a lack of asset optimization.\n\n7. **Opaque Reporting**: Some metrics, such as diluted earnings per share and return on equity, are missing or marked as '－' for certain years. While this could be due to legitimate reasons, the lack of transparency in key performance indicators is concerning.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight significant risks and potential red flags that warrant further investigation.

{"edinet_code": "E02791", "doc_id": "S1004ZQ9", "label": 0, "prob": 0.7, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report appears to have some unusual patterns and inconsistencies that could indicate potential red flags. Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Divergence Between Operating Performance and Net Profit**: The company reported a significant operating loss (営業利益) of -59,184,000 yen and a recurring loss (経常利益) of -55,860,000 yen for the current year. However, the net profit (当期純利益) is reported as 38,864,000 yen, which is a significant positive figure. This discrepancy is primarily due to a large one-time gain from the sale of investment securities (特別利益合計: 107,673,000 yen). While this is not inherently fraudulent, reliance on one-time gains to offset operating losses can be a red flag if it becomes a pattern.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Concerns**: The operating cash flow (営業キャッシュフロー) has been negative for the past three years, with the current year showing a further deterioration to -38,943,000 yen. This is concerning as it indicates the company is not generating sufficient cash from its core operations. Meanwhile, the investment cash flow (投資キャッシュフロー) shows a significant inflow of 71,047,000 yen, primarily due to the sale of investment securities. This reliance on asset sales to generate cash could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Allowances**: The allowance for doubtful accounts (貸倒引当金) decreased significantly from -1,675,000 yen in the prior year to -902,000 yen in the current year. This reduction, despite ongoing operating losses and negative cash flows, could be an attempt to artificially inflate net assets or reduce expenses.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Trends in Key Metrics**: The company's recurring profit margin (経常利益率) and return on equity (自己資本利益率) have fluctuated significantly over the years. For example, the recurring profit margin dropped from 0.31% in the prior year to a negative figure in the current year, while the return on equity jumped from 0.01 to 0.039. Such volatility in key financial metrics could indicate aggressive accounting practices.\n\n5. **Reliance on Borrowing**: The company has increased its short-term and long-term borrowings (短期借入金 and 長期借入金) in the current year, which could indicate a reliance on external financing to sustain operations. This is further supported by the negative operating cash flow and the need to sell assets to generate cash.\n\n6. **Unusual Stock Price Metrics**: The price-to-earnings ratio (株価収益率) has fluctuated significantly, from 230.4 two years ago to 39.6 in the current year. Such large swings could indicate market uncertainty about the company's financial health or potential manipulation of earnings.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above observations suggest potential red flags that warrant further investigation. The reliance on one-time gains, negative operating cash flows, and unusual changes in allowances are particularly concerning."}

However, there are a few areas worth noting for further scrutiny: \n1. The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted EPS) for 'Prior4Year' is missing ('－'), while data for subsequent years is available. This could be a data entry issue, but it is worth verifying why this data is absent. \n2. The '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) is reported as '－' (missing) for the 'CurrentYear,' despite being present in the 'Prior1Year.' While this could be legitimate, it is unusual for a company to have no impairment losses in a given year, especially if they had such losses in the prior year. \n3. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant positive value in 'Prior2Year' (828,269,000), which is an outlier compared to other years, where the values are negative. This could be due to a one-time asset sale or investment divestiture, but it warrants further investigation to confirm the nature of this anomaly. \n4. The '売上原価' (Cost of Sales) decreased slightly in the 'CurrentYear' compared to the 'Prior1Year,' while '売上高' (Net Sales) increased. This could indicate improved efficiency, but it is worth verifying if there were any changes in accounting policies or cost allocation methods. \n5. The '自己株式' (Treasury Stock) increased significantly in the 'CurrentYear,' which could indicate aggressive share buybacks. While not inherently fraudulent, this could be a strategy to manipulate EPS or stock prices, and it is worth understanding the rationale behind this increase. \n6. The '売上債権の増減額' (Change in Accounts Receivable) shows a significant negative value in the 'CurrentYear' (-542,158,000), indicating a large increase in accounts receivable. This could suggest potential issues with cash collection or aggressive revenue recognition practices. \n7. The '仕入債務の増減額' (Change in Accounts Payable) shows a significant positive value in the 'CurrentYear' (475,835,000), indicating an increase in accounts payable. This could be a sign of delayed payments to suppliers, which might be used to manage cash flow artificially. \nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that warrant further investigation to ensure the integrity of the financial statements."}

However, there are a few points that could raise concerns or warrant further investigation: \n\n1. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from operating activities (営業キャッシュフロー) shows a significant increase from 760,770,000 yen in the prior year to 5,121,722,000 yen in the current year. This is a dramatic change that is not clearly explained by other financial metrics, such as revenue or net income, which have decreased. Such a large discrepancy could indicate potential manipulation or misclassification of cash flows.\n\n2. **Investment Cash Flow Reversal**: The cash flow from investing activities (投資キャッシュフロー) has shifted from a consistent outflow in prior years to a significant inflow of 1,518,904,000 yen in the current year. This is primarily driven by the sale of investment securities (投資有価証券の売却による収入), which increased significantly. While this could be legitimate, the timing and magnitude of this change should be scrutinized to ensure it is not being used to offset other financial pressures.\n\n3. **Financial Cash Flow Anomaly**: The cash flow from financing activities (財務キャッシュフロー) has shifted from a positive inflow of 1,100,418,000 yen in the prior year to a significant outflow of -2,672,825,000 yen in the current year. This is primarily due to the repayment of long-term borrowings (長期借入金の返済による支出). While this could be a strategic decision, the sudden shift in financing strategy should be examined further.\n\n4. **Inventory and Accounts Receivable Trends**: Inventory (棚卸資産) and accounts receivable (売上債権) have both decreased significantly, which could indicate efforts to improve working capital. However, the magnitude of these changes, particularly the large decrease in accounts receivable, should be investigated to ensure they are not artificially inflated or manipulated.\n\n5. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The report shows a significant increase in gains from the sale of investment securities (投資有価証券売却益) and a large special loss (特別損失合計) in the current year. These items could be used to manage earnings and should be reviewed for legitimacy.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: There are several instances of missing data (e.g., 潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益 and 減損損失 in the current year). While this may be due to legitimate reasons, the absence of this information could obscure important details.\n\nWhile these points do not definitively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to ensure the integrity of the financial statements."}

While this could be due to genuine operational challenges, the magnitude of the decline warrants scrutiny.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) has decreased significantly, from 1,437 million yen in the prior year to 656 million yen in the current year. This is a substantial drop and is not fully explained by the changes in profitability alone. Additionally, the '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant increase in outflows, which could indicate aggressive investment or potential misclassification of cash flows.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Asset Accounts**: The '機械装置及び運搬具（純額）' (Net Machinery and Equipment) has nearly doubled from 232 million yen to 434 million yen, despite a decrease in the accumulated depreciation. This could indicate potential overstatement of asset values or misclassification.\n\n4. **Self-Stock Acquisition**: The company has acquired a significant amount of its own stock ('自己株式の取得による支出'), amounting to 238 million yen in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it could be used to manipulate financial ratios or stock prices.\n\n5. **Decline in '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income)**: Comprehensive income has dropped significantly, from 1,260 million yen in the prior year to 391 million yen in the current year. This decline is more pronounced than the drop in net income, suggesting potential issues with other comprehensive income components.\n\n6. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (Tax Adjustments) remains negative, which is consistent with prior years, but the magnitude of the adjustment has increased slightly. This could indicate potential tax planning strategies that should be reviewed.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: Several fields, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share), are consistently missing ('－'). While this may be due to the absence of dilutive securities, it is worth confirming.\n\nWhile none of these issues individually confirm fraudulent activity, the combination of declining profitability, unusual changes in cash flows and asset accounts, and other anomalies suggest a moderate probability of financial misrepresentation or aggressive accounting practices.

This is a notable decline, especially when other financial metrics like net income ('当期純利益') and operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュ・フロー') have not shown a proportional decline. This could indicate potential revenue recognition issues or aggressive cost-cutting measures to maintain profitability.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュ・フロー') has increased significantly from 994,000,000 to 1,902,000,000, despite the revenue decline. This could be due to changes in working capital, such as a large decrease in accounts receivable ('売上債権の増減額'), which increased cash flow. However, the decrease in accounts payable ('仕入債務の増減額') is unusually large (-1,051,000,000), which partially offsets this. These trends should be examined further to ensure they are not artificially manipulated.\n\n3. **Inventory Management**: The inventory ('棚卸資産') has decreased significantly, which could indicate aggressive inventory write-offs or sales at a discount to boost cash flow. This is not necessarily fraudulent but could be a sign of financial stress.\n\n4. **Fixed Asset Transactions**: The company reported a significant decrease in gains from the sale of fixed assets ('固定資産売却益'), from 51,000,000 to 21,000,000. Additionally, the impairment loss ('減損損失') has increased from 95,000,000 to 162,000,000. These could indicate potential issues with asset valuation or disposal practices.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The accounts payable ('支払手形及び買掛金') has decreased significantly from 2,971,000,000 to 1,919,000,000. This could indicate early payment to suppliers, which might be unusual if the company is facing revenue declines. Additionally, the short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') have increased slightly, which could indicate a need for liquidity.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: The report contains missing data for '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share), which is consistently marked as '－'. While this may not be unusual, it is worth confirming that there are no convertible securities or other instruments that could dilute earnings.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further scrutiny.

This is highly unusual and could indicate issues with revenue recognition or cash collection.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Working Capital**: The cash flow statement shows a significant increase in accounts receivable (売上債権の増減額) and inventory (棚卸資産の増減額), which could suggest aggressive revenue recognition practices or overstatement of inventory.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance (現金及び現金同等物) decreased by 630,069,000 yen, but this is not fully explained by the cash flow activities. The operating cash flow is almost negligible, and the investment and financing cash flows do not account for the full decrease.\n\n4. **Decline in Investment Cash Flow Outflows**: The investment cash flow outflows have decreased significantly compared to prior years, which could indicate a slowdown in capital investment. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it is worth investigating whether this aligns with the company's stated strategy or operational needs.\n\n5. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The corporate tax adjustment (法人税等調整額) is negative in the current year (-26,148,000 yen), which is a reversal from the prior year's positive adjustment. This could indicate aggressive tax planning or unusual tax treatments.\n\n6. **Lack of Disclosure on Diluted Earnings Per Share**: The absence of diluted earnings per share (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) for all years is unusual, especially if the company has issued any convertible securities or stock options. This could indicate a lack of transparency.\n\n7. **Significant Decrease in Dividend Payments**: The dividend payments (配当金の支払額) have decreased significantly from 516,697,000 yen to 367,400,000 yen, despite an increase in net income. This could indicate cash flow constraints or a shift in dividend policy, which should be explained in the report.\n\nWhile these issues do not definitively indicate fraud, they raise questions about the company's financial practices and warrant further investigation."}

These changes could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or delayed payments to suppliers, which may be used to manipulate financial results.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Trends in Key Metrics**: The '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income) shows a positive value in the current year, despite the company reporting a net loss. This inconsistency could be due to unrealized gains or other non-operating items, but it should be examined further to ensure there is no manipulation.\n\n5. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) turned positive in the current year, primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings.

The significant drop in '現金及び現金同等物の残高' (cash and cash equivalents) from 24.1 billion yen in the prior year to 10.7 billion yen in the current year, despite a positive operating cash flow. This is primarily driven by a large negative cash flow from investing activities (-14.6 billion yen). The report attributes this to '投資有価証券の取得による支出' (acquisition of investment securities), which increased significantly from -180 million yen in the prior year to -7.8 billion yen in the current year. This sudden and substantial increase in investment activity warrants further scrutiny to ensure it is legitimate and not an attempt to obscure cash flow issues.\n2. The '投資有価証券売却益' (gain on sale of investment securities) increased significantly from 3 million yen in the prior year to 188 million yen in the current year. While this is not inherently suspicious, it coincides with the large acquisition of investment securities, which could indicate potential round-tripping or other manipulative practices.\n3. The '包括利益' (comprehensive income) shows significant volatility, dropping from 5.5 billion yen two years ago to 1.6 billion yen in the prior year, and then slightly recovering to 2.1 billion yen in the current year. This volatility is not explained in the report and could indicate issues with the valuation of certain assets or liabilities.\n4. The '非支配株主持分' (non-controlling interests) increased from 75 million yen in the prior year to 168 million yen in the current year.

This discrepancy between profitability and cash flow generation could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or issues with receivables collection.\n\n2. **Significant Increase in Receivables**: The '売掛金' (accounts receivable) has increased substantially from 9,856,494,000 to 11,566,916,000, which is a 17.3% increase year-over-year. This is disproportionate to the revenue growth of 26.2% (from 46,729,996,000 to 58,972,245,000). This could suggest that the company is recognizing revenue prematurely or has issues with customer payments.\n\n3. **Inventory Build-Up**: The '棚卸資産' (inventory) has increased significantly, with '商品及び製品' (finished goods) rising from 5,444,059,000 to 7,103,011,000. This could indicate overproduction or difficulty in selling products, which might lead to future write-downs.\n\n4. **Declining Self-Financing Ratio**: The '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) has been declining steadily over the years, from 38.3% four years ago to 29.1% in the current year. This indicates increasing reliance on debt, which is also evident from the significant increase in '短期借入金' (short-term borrowings) from 4,120,000,000 to 7,512,000,000.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Special Items**: The '特別利益合計' (extraordinary income) has increased significantly from 1,661,000 to 31,409,000, primarily due to '投資有価証券売却益' (gain on sale of investment securities). This could be a one-time event used to boost profitability.\n\n6. **Negative Hedge Accounting Impact**: The '繰延ヘッジ損益' (deferred hedge gains/losses) has shifted from a positive 241,768,000 to a negative -13,333,000.

Similarly, the company has been reporting losses in net income for the past three years. While this could be due to genuine business challenges, the consistent decline without a clear explanation in the report could be a concern.\n\n2. **Unusual Fluctuations in Cash Flows**: The cash flow from investing activities shows a significant positive inflow in the 'Prior3Year' (5.45 billion yen), which is an outlier compared to other years. This could indicate a one-time event, such as the sale of a major asset, but the report does not provide sufficient details to explain this anomaly.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Employee Trends**: The number of employees has been decreasing over the years, which aligns with the declining revenue. However, the average temporary staff numbers are disproportionately high compared to the permanent staff, and the decline in temporary staff is not as steep as the decline in permanent staff. This could indicate potential misclassification of employees or an attempt to manipulate labor costs.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The value of '建物及び構築物 (Buildings and Structures)' and '土地 (Land)' has remained relatively stable, but the '減価償却累計額 (Accumulated Depreciation)' has increased significantly. This is expected, but the report does not provide details on whether new assets were acquired or if the depreciation policy has changed.\n\n5. **Negative Equity Trends**: The company's '利益剰余金 (Retained Earnings)' has been negative for multiple years, and the '自己資本比率 (Equity Ratio)' has been declining, reaching 12.95% in the current year. This indicates financial instability and raises concerns about the company's ability to sustain operations.\n\n6. **Unexplained Adjustments in Tax and Interest**: The '法人税等調整額 (Tax Adjustments)' and '支払利息 (Interest Payments)' show fluctuations that are not clearly explained in the report. For example, the tax adjustment in the 'Prior1Year' is negative (-10.49 million yen), while it is positive in the current year (8.81 million yen).\n\n7. **Potential Overstatement of Cash Flow**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー (Operating Cash Flow)' has improved in the current year despite declining revenue and profitability.

Additionally, the company has been reporting consistent losses ('経常利益', '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益', '包括利益') for all years, with a significant increase in losses in the current year. This could indicate operational inefficiencies or mismanagement.\n\n2. **Negative Equity**: The '１株当たり純資産額' (Net assets per share) has turned negative in the current year, which is a significant red flag. This suggests that the company's liabilities exceed its assets, indicating insolvency.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has turned significantly negative in the current year, despite a reduction in '販売費及び一般管理費' (SG&A expenses). This is inconsistent and raises questions about the company's cash management and operational efficiency.\n\n4. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company has significantly increased its short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') in the current year, which could indicate liquidity issues.

Such a drastic decline in revenue is unusual and should be explained in the report. However, no explanation or context is provided.\n\n2. **Profitability Trends**: The company has been consistently unprofitable for the past five years, with negative '経常利益' (ordinary income) and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders). While this alone is not indicative of fraud, the lack of a clear turnaround strategy or explanation for the continued losses is concerning.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has turned positive in the current year (101 million yen) after being significantly negative in the prior year (-872 million yen). This sudden improvement is not supported by corresponding improvements in revenue or profitability, raising questions about the source of the positive cash flow.\n\n4. **Unusual Financing Activities**: In the prior year, the company reported a massive inflow of cash from long-term borrowings ('長期借入れによる収入') of 8.6 billion yen, which is absent in the current year.

While this could be due to legitimate reasons, the lack of transparency is concerning.\n\n8. **Unusual Asset Trends**: The company's total assets ('総資産額') have remained relatively stable over the years, but the composition of assets shows unusual trends. For example, the '建物及び構築物（純額）' (buildings and structures, net) decreased, while '土地' (land) remained unchanged. This could indicate potential asset revaluation or misclassification.\n\n9. **Debt Levels**: The company has a high level of long-term debt ('長期借入金') at 8.6 billion yen, which has not decreased over the past year. This raises concerns about the company's ability to service its debt, especially given its continued losses.\n\n10. **Lack of Explanations**: The report lacks detailed explanations for significant changes in financial metrics, such as the drastic revenue drop, the sudden improvement in operating cash flow, and the absence of financing activities in the current year. This lack of transparency is a red flag.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the logical inconsistencies, lack of transparency, and unusual trends in the data suggest a moderate probability of fraudulent activities or at least misrepresentation of the company's financial position."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Significant Decline in Revenue and Profitability**: The company's revenue has been declining consistently over the past five years, with a sharp drop in the most recent year. Additionally, the company has moved from profitability to significant losses, as evidenced by the negative '経常利益' (ordinary profit) and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders). While this could be due to external factors, such as market conditions, the lack of a clear explanation in the report raises concerns.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The '建物及び構築物（純額）' (buildings and structures, net) increased significantly from the prior year, despite the company's declining revenue and profitability. This could indicate potential overstatement of asset values or misclassification of expenses as capital expenditures.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The company reported a positive '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) in the current year, despite a significant net loss. This discrepancy could be due to non-cash adjustments, but the report does not provide sufficient detail to verify this. Additionally, the '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a large outflow, which is unusual given the company's financial struggles.\n\n4. **Reduction in Workforce**: The number of employees ('従業員数') and temporary staff ('平均臨時雇用人員') has been decreasing steadily, which could indicate operational downsizing. However, this is not accompanied by a proportional reduction in expenses, raising questions about cost management.\n\n5. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The company reported a '固定資産売却益' (gain on sale of fixed assets) and a significant reduction in '減損損失' (impairment losses) compared to the prior year. These items could be used to manipulate earnings, especially in a year of poor performance.\n\n6. **Debt Management Concerns**: The company has a high level of debt, as indicated by the '長期借入金' (long-term borrowings) and '短期借入金' (short-term borrowings). The increase in short-term borrowings in the current year, despite declining revenue, could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Ratios**: The '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) has remained relatively stable, despite significant changes in revenue, profitability, and asset values. This could indicate potential manipulation of equity or liabilities to maintain a favorable ratio.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation.

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Revenue and Profitability Discrepancy**: The company's revenue has increased significantly from the prior year (from 64.3 billion yen to 118 billion yen, an 83% increase), but its profitability has deteriorated, with operating profit turning negative (-851 million yen) and net income also negative (-1.02 billion yen). This is unusual as such a large increase in revenue would typically lead to improved profitability unless there are extraordinary circumstances.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Issues**: The operating cash flow has turned significantly negative (-5.78 billion yen) despite the revenue increase. This suggests that the company may be struggling to convert its sales into cash, which could indicate issues with revenue recognition or collection of receivables.\n\n3. **Receivables and Payables**: The balance sheet shows a massive increase in accounts receivable (from 3.05 billion yen to 19.74 billion yen), which is disproportionate to the revenue growth. This could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or potential issues with collectability. Similarly, accounts payable have also increased significantly (from 5.47 billion yen to 14.27 billion yen), which could suggest liquidity issues or delayed payments to suppliers.\n\n4. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The income statement includes a large 'negative goodwill' gain (4.37 billion yen), which is a non-recurring item. This could be used to offset operating losses and inflate profitability. Additionally, there is a significant increase in impairment losses (from 545 million yen to 3.88 billion yen), which could indicate overstatement of asset values in prior periods.\n\n5. **Employee Growth**: The number of employees has increased dramatically over the years (from 422 to 2009), which is inconsistent with the company's financial performance. This could indicate potential misreporting of employee numbers or inefficiencies in operations.\n\n6. **Debt and Liquidity**: The company has increased its short-term borrowings significantly (from 2.48 billion yen to 5.31 billion yen), which could indicate liquidity issues. The cash and cash equivalents have also decreased (from 7.16 billion yen to 4.95 billion yen), further highlighting potential liquidity concerns.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Metrics**: The company's equity per share and return on equity have both declined, which is inconsistent with the reported revenue growth. This could indicate issues with the quality of earnings or potential manipulation of financial metrics.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the logical inconsistencies and unusual trends in the data suggest a higher probability of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices."}

The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) is consistently marked as '－' (missing) across all years. While this could be due to the company not having any dilutive securities, it is worth verifying if this is accurate or if there is an omission.\n\n2. The '退職給付に係る資産' (Retirement Benefit Assets) and '退職給付に係る負債' (Retirement Benefit Liabilities) show a significant change. In the prior year, there was no retirement benefit asset, but in the current year, it is reported as 2,082,000,000 yen. Similarly, the retirement benefit liability was not reported in the prior year but appears as 1,441,000,000 yen in the current year. This sudden change in reporting could indicate a change in accounting policy or a reclassification, which should be clarified.\n\n3. The '投資有価証券売却益' (Gain on Sale of Investment Securities) shows a significant increase from 53,000,000 yen in the prior year to 1,261,000,000 yen in the current year. This could be a one-time event, but it is worth investigating if this was used to inflate profits artificially.\n\n4. The '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) increased from 983,000,000 yen in the prior year to 1,294,000,000 yen in the current year. While this could be due to normal business operations, it is worth verifying if the impairment was appropriately justified and not used to manipulate earnings.\n\n5. The '短期借入金の純増減額' (Net Increase/Decrease in Short-Term Borrowings) shows a significant shift from an increase of 2,115,000,000 yen in the prior year to a decrease of 1,245,000,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate a change in the company's financing strategy, but it should be verified if this aligns with the company's overall financial strategy.\n\n6. The '自己株式の取得による支出' (Expenditure for Acquisition of Treasury Stock) is reported as 0 yen in the prior year but 2,000,000 yen in the current year. While this is a small amount, it is worth verifying if this was properly disclosed and accounted for.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas that warrant further investigation, there is no definitive evidence of fraudulent activity based on the provided data.

However, there are a few points that could raise concerns or warrant further investigation: \n\n1. **Sudden Increase in Operating Cash Flow**: The operating cash flow increased significantly from 3,382 million yen in the prior year to 5,688 million yen in the current year. While this could be due to improved operational efficiency, the magnitude of the increase should be cross-verified with operational changes or external factors.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Depreciation and Fixed Assets**: The depreciation expense increased slightly, but the net value of buildings and structures increased significantly (from 14,883 million yen to 16,487 million yen). This could indicate aggressive capitalization of expenses or revaluation of assets, which should be verified.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Short-Term Borrowings**: Short-term borrowings decreased significantly (from 4,550 million yen to 3,400 million yen), while the company reported a significant increase in cash and cash equivalents. This could indicate potential window dressing to improve liquidity ratios.\n\n4. **Negative Trends in Investment Cash Flow**: The investment cash flow remains negative and has worsened (from -2,433 million yen to -3,599 million yen). This is not inherently fraudulent but should be analyzed in the context of the company's investment strategy and whether it aligns with its operational performance.\n\n5. **Omission of Data**: Some data points, such as '貸倒引当金' (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) and '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio), are missing or represented as '－'. While this could be a parsing error, it is important to ensure that these omissions are not intentional to obscure unfavorable information.\n\n6. **Significant Increase in Tax Payments**: The corporate tax payments increased significantly (from 289 million yen to 913 million yen). This could be due to the increase in profits, but the magnitude of the increase should be verified against the tax rate and any changes in tax regulations.\n\nOverall, while there are no definitive signs of fraud, the above points suggest areas that require further scrutiny to rule out potential manipulation or misrepresentation."}

This is accompanied by a negative '経常利益' (ordinary profit) and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders) for the current year. While declining performance is not inherently fraudulent, it could indicate financial stress, which might incentivize fraudulent reporting.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has dropped significantly from 354 in the prior year to 304 in the current year, while the average temporary staff ('平均臨時雇用人員') also decreased. This could be a sign of operational downsizing, but the report does not provide sufficient context or explanation for this change.\n\n3. **Significant Special Losses**: The company reported a large '減損損失' (impairment loss) in the prior year and a smaller but still notable amount in the current year. While impairment losses are not unusual, the magnitude and recurrence of these losses warrant further scrutiny, as they could be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n4. **Unexplained Changes in Assets and Liabilities**: There are notable changes in certain balance sheet items, such as a significant increase in 'その他' (other assets) under current assets and a decrease in '支払手形及び買掛金' (accounts payable). These changes are not explained in the report and could indicate potential reclassification or misstatement of accounts.\n\n5. **Negative Equity Trends**: The company's '純資産額' (net assets) has been declining over the years, with a significant drop in the prior year. The '利益剰余金' (retained earnings) is negative and worsening, which could indicate accumulated losses. This raises concerns about the company's financial stability and potential incentives to misstate financial results.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has decreased significantly in the current year, while the financing cash flow ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') turned positive due to an increase in short-term borrowings. This could indicate liquidity issues, which might pressure management to manipulate financial results.\n\n7. **Lack of Detail in Certain Items**: Several items, such as 'その他' (other) in various sections, lack detailed breakdowns or explanations. This lack of transparency could be a red flag for potential misstatements or concealment of unfavorable information.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation.

Firstly, the company's cash and cash equivalents have increased dramatically from 1.7 billion yen in the prior year to 7.4 billion yen in the current year, which is a significant jump. This increase is primarily driven by a large inflow in financing cash flow (5.75 billion yen), which includes a substantial increase in long-term borrowings (9.4 billion yen) and a significant outflow for the acquisition of treasury stock (1.26 billion yen). Such a large increase in borrowings, coupled with a decrease in equity (as seen in the drop in net assets), could indicate financial distress or an attempt to manipulate liquidity metrics. Secondly, the company's net income has swung from a loss of 52.3 million yen in the prior year to a profit of 96.6 million yen in the current year, despite a decline in operating profit and a significant increase in special losses (e.g., impairment losses). This inconsistency raises questions about the quality of earnings and whether non-recurring items are being used to inflate profitability. Thirdly, the company's equity ratio has dropped significantly from 32.8% in the prior year to 21.3% in the current year, indicating a sharp increase in leverage. This is further supported by the increase in long-term debt and the decrease in retained earnings. Lastly, the report contains several missing or incomplete data points (e.g., '－' for diluted earnings per share in multiple years), which could indicate a lack of transparency.

This could indicate issues with cash collection or operational inefficiencies that are not clearly explained in the report.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents (現金及び現金同等物) decreased significantly by 1.56 billion yen in the current year, yet the financial activities (財務キャッシュフロー) show a much smaller outflow of 699 million yen. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of cash flow reporting or potential unreported transactions.\n\n3. **Unexplained Changes in Liabilities**: The short-term borrowings (短期借入金) decreased by 400 million yen, and accounts payable (支払手形及び買掛金) decreased by 760 million yen. These reductions are not accompanied by corresponding explanations or significant changes in operational activities, which could indicate potential misclassification or manipulation of liabilities.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Reporting of Extraordinary Items**: The prior year's extraordinary income (特別利益合計) included a fixed asset sale gain of 296 million yen, but no such income is reported in the current year, despite a small amount of revenue from the sale of tangible fixed assets (有形固定資産の売却による収入). This inconsistency could suggest incomplete or selective reporting of extraordinary items.\n\n5. **Negative Trends in Profitability**: The company's net income (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益) and operating profit (営業利益) have both declined significantly compared to the prior year.

Similarly, '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income) also turned negative. This is a drastic change that is not fully explained in the report.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The company reported a significant negative cash flow from investing activities ('投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') of -4.66 billion yen, which is much larger than in previous years. This is coupled with a negative cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') of -591 million yen, a stark contrast to the prior year's positive 5.75 billion yen. The reasons for these large cash outflows are not clearly detailed.\n\n3. **Unusual Asset Movements**: The balance sheet shows a significant increase in '土地' (Land) from 5.28 billion yen to 7.43 billion yen, which is unusual given the company's financial struggles.

This indicates increasing reliance on debt, which is risky given the company's declining profitability.\n\n5. **Unexplained Changes in Key Accounts**: There are unexplained changes in several accounts, such as a significant increase in '商品及び製品' (Merchandise and Finished Goods) and '投資有価証券' (Investment Securities). These changes are not accompanied by sufficient explanations in the report.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (Income Tax Adjustments) shows a large swing from -197.6 million yen in the prior year to 36.8 million yen in the current year.

This could indicate a reporting error or manipulation.\n\n2. **Negative and Volatile Profitability**: The company has reported significant fluctuations in '当期純利益又は当期純損失' (Net Income), swinging from profits in some years to losses in others. The most recent year shows a loss of '-52347000', which is a sharp decline from the prior year's profit of '229970000'. This inconsistency, combined with the declining '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit), raises concerns about the company's financial stability and transparency.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) has significantly decreased from '1896735000' in the Prior1Year to '829569000' in the CurrentYear, despite relatively stable revenue. This could indicate issues with cash management or potential misrepresentation of cash flows.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The '流動負債' (Current Liabilities) has increased significantly from '6936222000' in the Prior1Year to '9536090000' in the CurrentYear, while '非流動負債' (Non-Current Liabilities) has decreased from '6069232000' to '4692871000'. This shift in liability structure is unusual and may indicate financial engineering or reclassification of liabilities.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Tax Reporting**: The '法人税等調整額' (Income Tax Adjustment) shows a significant swing from '11306000' in the Prior1Year to '-42807000' in the CurrentYear. Such large adjustments are unusual and could indicate aggressive tax planning or errors in tax reporting.\n\n6. **Declining Employee Metrics**: While the '従業員数' (Number of Employees) has remained relatively stable, the '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) has increased significantly from '3512' in the Prior1Year to '3695' in the CurrentYear.

This sharp turnaround, especially when paired with a relatively stable '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit), raises questions about the source of this improvement. \n\n2. **High '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)**: The P/E ratio for the current year is extremely high (1790.6), which is unusual and could indicate either an overvaluation of the company's stock or manipulation of earnings to present a more favorable financial position.\n\n3. **Significant Changes in '純資産額' (Net Assets)**: The net assets have increased substantially from the prior year (5,495,232,000) to the current year (8,671,238,000).

This is coupled with a reduction in short-term borrowings and an increase in long-term borrowings, which could indicate potential liquidity issues or aggressive financial restructuring.\n\n5. **Reduction in '短期借入金' (Short-Term Borrowings)**: The short-term borrowings have decreased significantly from the prior year (3,800,000,000) to the current year (1,300,000,000). While this could be a positive sign of reduced reliance on short-term debt, it could also indicate a shift to long-term debt to mask liquidity issues.\n\n6. **Unusual Changes in '減損損失' (Impairment Losses)**: The impairment losses have decreased significantly from the prior year (514,842,000) to the current year (72,998,000).

This inconsistency could indicate potential earnings management or operational instability.\n\n2. **Negative Operating Profit**: The company reported a negative operating profit ('営業利益') in the current year, despite a slight increase in revenue ('売上高'). This could suggest inefficiencies or mismanagement in controlling costs, or it could be an attempt to manipulate expenses.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a significant positive inflow in the current year, primarily due to long-term borrowings ('長期借入れによる収入'). This could indicate reliance on debt to sustain operations, which might mask underlying financial difficulties.\n\n4. **Declining Equity**: The company's net assets ('純資産') have been declining over the years, which is concerning. This trend, combined with the negative net income, could indicate financial distress.\n\n5. **High Special Losses**: The company has reported significant special losses ('特別損失合計') in both the prior year and the current year.

This could indicate potential overstatement of assets.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise concerns about the company's financial health and transparency.

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation: \n\n1. **Significant Increase in Long-Term Borrowings**: The long-term borrowings have increased drastically from 4,880,448,000 yen in the prior year to 9,743,421,000 yen in the current year. This is a significant jump, and while it could be justified by business expansion or other strategic investments, the corresponding increase in fixed assets (e.g., property, plant, and equipment) does not seem proportionate. This raises questions about the use of these funds.\n\n2. **Decline in Operating Cash Flow**: The operating cash flow has dropped significantly from 1,829,750,000 yen in the prior year to 979,192,000 yen in the current year, despite relatively stable revenue and gross profit. This could indicate issues with cash collection or increased operational inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The financial cash flow has shifted from a significant outflow (-2,455,497,000 yen) in the prior year to a large inflow (3,567,104,000 yen) in the current year. This is primarily driven by the increase in long-term borrowings. Such a drastic change in financing activities without a clear explanation could be a red flag.\n\n4. **Decline in Equity and Self-Sufficiency Ratios**: The equity (純資産) has decreased from 4,871,928,000 yen to 4,337,433,000 yen, and the self-sufficiency ratio (自己資本比率) has dropped from 32.1% to 21.5%. This indicates a weakening financial position, which could be a result of excessive borrowing or other financial mismanagement.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The net value of machinery and equipment has dropped significantly from 34,421,000 yen to 555,000 yen, which is unusual and could indicate asset write-offs or mismanagement. Additionally, the land value has decreased from 2,635,435,000 yen to 1,029,532,000 yen, which is a significant drop and warrants further explanation.\n\n6. **Large Special Losses**: The current year includes a significant special loss (特別損失合計) of 534,304,000 yen, which was not present in the prior year. This could indicate asset impairments or other one-time losses that need to be scrutinized.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents have increased significantly from 2,801,830,000 yen to 7,245,154,000 yen, despite the decline in operating cash flow. This is primarily driven by financing activities, but the overall cash management strategy seems inconsistent.\n\n8. **Discrepancies in Temporary Employment**: The average temporary employment has fluctuated significantly over the years, from 36 to 62 to 38. While this may not directly indicate fraud, it could suggest inconsistencies in workforce management or reporting.\n\n9. **Missing Data**: The absence of data for diluted earnings per share (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) in the current year is unusual and could indicate incomplete or selective reporting.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further investigation, particularly around the use of borrowed funds, the decline in equity, and the significant changes in fixed assets and special losses."}

However, there are several non-numerical and logical red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Significant Increase in Equity Despite Modest Profitability**: The company's '純資産額' (net assets) increased dramatically from 4,337,433,000 yen in the prior year to 10,666,965,000 yen in the current year. This is a significant jump, especially when the '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders) only slightly decreased from 1,115,017,000 yen to 1,066,066,000 yen. The increase in equity is primarily driven by a reduction in '自己株式' (treasury stock) from -6,771,161,000 yen to -1,791,161,000 yen. While this could be due to a buyback or cancellation of treasury stock, the scale of the change warrants further investigation.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Treasury Stock**: The drastic reduction in '自己株式' (treasury stock) is not accompanied by a clear explanation in the report. Such a significant change could indicate manipulation of equity to improve financial ratios or present a stronger financial position.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Cash Flow and Borrowing**: The cash flow statement shows a significant reduction in long-term borrowings ('長期借入金') from 9,743,421,000 yen to 6,225,363,000 yen. However, the financing cash flow ('財務キャッシュフロー') remains positive at 1,383,683,000 yen, which is unusual given the repayment of borrowings. This could indicate potential misclassification or incomplete disclosure of financing activities.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Depreciation Trends**: The depreciation expense ('減価償却費及び償却費') increased significantly from 416,097,000 yen to 551,561,000 yen, despite only modest changes in fixed assets. This could suggest aggressive depreciation policies or potential overstatement of depreciation to reduce taxable income.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: There are missing values in key metrics such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) for the prior year and current year. While this may be due to the absence of dilutive securities, the lack of explanation raises questions about the completeness of the report.\n\n6. **Unusual Changes in Inventory and Payables**: The inventory ('棚卸資産') increased significantly, while accounts payable ('仕入債務') also increased. This could indicate potential issues with inventory management or aggressive revenue recognition practices.\n\n7. **Unexplained Gains and Losses**: The report shows a significant drop in '特別利益合計' (extraordinary income) from 141,357,000 yen to 9,777,000 yen and the absence of '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) in the current year. The lack of explanation for these changes raises concerns about the transparency of the report.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements."}

This is coupled with a significant increase in '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio), which is unusually high at 196.61, suggesting that the stock price may not align with the company's earnings performance. This could indicate potential overvaluation or manipulation of stock prices.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flows**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) has decreased significantly, while '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a large outflow. Additionally, '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) has turned negative after being positive in the prior year. These shifts could indicate liquidity issues or mismanagement of funds.\n\n3. **Sharp Increase in '自己株式' (Treasury Stock)**: The company has significantly increased its treasury stock ('自己株式') from -1,791,161,000 to -2,791,128,000. This could be an attempt to artificially inflate earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of outstanding shares.\n\n4. **Unusual '特別損失合計' (Extraordinary Losses)**: The current year shows a large extraordinary loss of 423,249,000, which was absent in the prior year. This could be an attempt to hide operational losses under extraordinary items.\n\n5. **Discrepancy in '純資産額' (Net Assets)**: The net assets have decreased from 10,666,965,000 to 9,655,251,000, despite the company reporting a positive net income. This could indicate unreported losses or other adjustments.\n\n6. **Inconsistent '従業員数' (Number of Employees)**: The number of employees has decreased from 662 to 602, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) has increased from 44 to 52. This shift could indicate cost-cutting measures or an attempt to manipulate labor costs.\n\n7. **Unusual 'リース資産' (Leased Assets)**: The company reports leased assets for the first time in the current year (278,000,000), which could indicate a change in accounting policies or an attempt to capitalize operating leases.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they warrant further investigation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}

Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Significant Decline in Profitability**: The company has reported a sharp decline in profitability, with the '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) turning from a small profit in the prior year to a massive loss in the current year (-1.95 billion yen). This is accompanied by a significant '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) of 1.98 billion yen, which is unusually high and could be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Trends in Key Metrics**: The '純資産額' (Net Assets) and '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio) have declined significantly, which is inconsistent with the company's historical performance. Additionally, the '総資産額' (Total Assets) has remained relatively stable, which raises questions about the source of the losses.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant outflow of 4.64 billion yen, which is much higher than in previous years. This could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or potential misclassification of expenses. Meanwhile, the '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) shows a large inflow of 1.61 billion yen, primarily from bond issuance, which could be an attempt to cover operational shortfalls.\n\n4. **Discrepancies in Employee Numbers**: The '従業員数' (Number of Employees) has decreased from 602 to 565, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) has increased significantly from 52 to 77. This could indicate cost-cutting measures or an attempt to manipulate labor costs.\n\n5. **Unusual Accounting Entries**: The report includes a new entry for '社債発行費、繰延資産' (Bond Issuance Costs, Deferred Assets) of 16.79 million yen, which was not present in the prior year. This could be a legitimate expense, but its sudden appearance warrants scrutiny.\n\n6. **High Leverage and Debt Management**: The company has issued new bonds and taken on additional long-term debt, while simultaneously reducing short-term debt. This could indicate liquidity issues or an attempt to restructure debt to improve short-term financial metrics.\n\n7. **Lack of Detailed Explanations**: The report does not provide sufficient explanations for the significant changes in key metrics, such as the impairment loss, the large cash outflows in investing activities, and the increase in temporary employees. This lack of transparency is concerning.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above observations suggest potential red flags that could indicate fraudulent activities or at least poor financial management."}

However, there are several logical and operational red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Declining Revenue and Profitability**: The company's revenue has been consistently declining over the past five years, from 99.55 billion yen to 51.63 billion yen. Similarly, the net income attributable to parent company shareholders has been negative for the past four years, with only a slight improvement in the current year. This trend could indicate operational inefficiencies or market challenges, but it is not necessarily fraudulent.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from operating activities has fluctuated significantly, with large negative values in some years (e.g., -9.08 billion yen in Prior4Year) and a positive value in the current year (2.18 billion yen). While this could be due to legitimate operational changes, such volatility warrants further investigation.\n\n3. **Significant Changes in Fixed Assets**: The company's fixed assets have decreased significantly, from 30.16 billion yen in Prior1Year to 19.97 billion yen in the CurrentYear. This could be due to asset sales or impairments, but the reasons for such a large reduction should be clarified.\n\n4. **Employee Count Decline**: The number of employees has decreased significantly, from 1,716 in Prior4Year to 1,342 in the CurrentYear. While this could be part of a cost-cutting strategy, it may also indicate financial distress or operational downsizing.\n\n5. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The company reported significant gains from the sale of fixed assets and investment securities in the CurrentYear, which helped offset its losses. This reliance on non-operational income could be a red flag if it is being used to mask poor operational performance.\n\n6. **High Stock Price Volatility**: The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been extremely volatile, with negative values in recent years and a very high negative value (-80.6) in the CurrentYear. This could indicate market uncertainty or lack of investor confidence.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Reporting of Certain Items**: Some items, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share), are consistently reported as '－' (not applicable). While this may be legitimate, it is worth verifying why this information is not provided.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation. The company's reliance on non-operational income, significant asset reductions, and declining employee count could be indicative of financial distress or potential manipulation to present a more favorable financial position."}

This is inconsistent with the recovery in other metrics like '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders), which rebounded significantly from a large loss (-29,838,000,000) to a substantial profit (387,283,000,000). Such discrepancies in trends between related metrics are unusual.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) shows a massive recovery from a negative value (-1,465,121,000,000) in the prior year to a positive value (1,112,894,000,000) in the current year. However, '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) and '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) show highly volatile and inconsistent patterns, with the current year's investing cash flow being significantly negative (-5,758,240,000,000). Such extreme fluctuations in cash flows without clear explanations could indicate manipulation.\n\n3. **Discrepancies in Tax Reporting**: The '法人所得税費用' (corporate income tax expense) shows a significant swing from a negative value (-53,433,000,000) in the prior year to a large positive value (131,861,000,000) in the current year. This is inconsistent with the recovery in '税引前利益' (profit before tax), which also shows a large swing from a negative value (-65,391,000,000) to a positive value (522,860,000,000). The magnitude of the tax expense change seems disproportionate and warrants further scrutiny.\n\n4. **Unusual Asset and Liability Movements**: The '土地' (land) value increased significantly from 396,521,000,000 to 515,269,000,000, and '建設仮勘定' (construction in progress) also increased substantially. However, these increases are not clearly explained in the report and could indicate potential overstatement of assets. Additionally, the '社債' (bonds payable) decreased significantly from 2,093,598,000,000 to 1,242,436,000,000, which is unusual without a clear explanation of how the debt was reduced.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Employee Trends**: The '従業員数' (number of employees) and '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) both show a declining trend, which is inconsistent with the recovery in profitability and cash flows. A recovering company would typically stabilize or increase its workforce.\n\n6. **Unusual Dividend Payment**: The '配当金の支払額' (dividend payments) dropped to zero in the current year, despite the company reporting a significant recovery in profitability. This is unusual and could indicate cash flow issues or an attempt to conserve cash for other purposes.\n\n7. **Negative Comprehensive Income Despite Profitability**: The '包括利益' (comprehensive income) remains negative in the current year, despite the company reporting a significant profit. This inconsistency could indicate issues with other comprehensive income components, such as unrealized losses on securities or foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, the logical inconsistencies and unusual patterns in the data suggest a moderate probability of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices."}

This inconsistency could indicate issues with the valuation of assets or liabilities, or the use of aggressive accounting practices.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies:** The operating cash flow (営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) has been negative for four consecutive years, yet the company remains operational and reports profits. This could indicate reliance on non-operational income or external financing, which may not be sustainable. Additionally, the significant drop in cash and cash equivalents (現金及び現金同等物) from the Prior 1 Year (57,227,000,000) to the Current Year (31,175,000,000) is concerning, especially given the negative operating cash flow.\n\n3. **Decline in Employee Numbers:** The number of employees (従業員数) has been steadily decreasing over the years, from 664 in the Prior 4 Year to 610 in the Current Year. While this could be due to operational efficiency, it may also indicate financial distress or downsizing, which is not reflected in the profitability metrics.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Other Comprehensive Income (評価・換算差額等):** The significant drop in 'Other Valuation and Translation Adjustments' (評価・換算差額等) from 3,173,000,000 in the Prior 1 Year to 1,444,000,000 in the Current Year could suggest issues with the valuation of securities or foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Depreciation and Impairment Losses:** The depreciation expense (減価償却費及び償却費) decreased from 622,000,000 in the Prior 1 Year to 579,000,000 in the Current Year, while impairment losses (減損損失) dropped significantly from 140,000,000 to 1,000,000. This sharp decline in impairment losses could indicate underreporting or delayed recognition of asset impairments.\n\n6. **Negative Investment Cash Flow:** The investment cash flow (投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) has been highly volatile, with large positive values in the Prior 3 Year and Prior 2 Year, followed by significant negative values in the Prior 1 Year and Current Year. This inconsistency could indicate aggressive investment strategies or potential misclassification of cash flows.\n\n7. **Unusual Shareholder Equity Per Share (１株当たり純資産額):** The shareholder equity per share dropped significantly from 3,069.14 in the Prior 1 Year to 2,954.08 in the Current Year, despite the reported profitability. This could indicate dilution of equity or other adjustments not clearly explained in the report.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise questions about the company's financial health, accounting practices, and transparency.

Firstly, the company's '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net income attributable to parent company shareholders) and '包括利益' (Comprehensive income) show a dramatic turnaround from significant losses in the prior year to substantial profits in the current year. This is unusual, especially given that '売上高' (Revenue) has only slightly increased, and '経常利益' (Ordinary profit) remains negative. Such a discrepancy suggests that the reported profit may be driven by non-operating or extraordinary items rather than core business performance. This is further supported by the large '特別利益合計' (Extraordinary income) in the current year, which is significantly higher than in the prior year. The source of this extraordinary income should be scrutinized.Secondly, the '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash flow from operating activities) has surged dramatically from a negative value in the prior year to a very high positive value in the current year. This is inconsistent with the company's negative '経常利益' (Ordinary profit) and declining '営業利益' (Operating profit). Such a mismatch between cash flow and profitability metrics could indicate potential manipulation of cash flow figures.Thirdly, the '資本剰余金' (Capital surplus) has decreased significantly, while '利益剰余金' (Retained earnings) has increased dramatically. This could indicate a reclassification or adjustment that may not be transparent. Additionally, the '法人税等調整額' (Income tax adjustment) has shifted from a negative value in the prior year to a large positive value in the current year, which is unusual and warrants further explanation.Lastly, the company's '長期借入金' (Long-term borrowings) has decreased, and '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash flow from financing activities) has turned negative, suggesting a reduction in debt. However, this is inconsistent with the company's need for cash given its negative profitability metrics.While the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, these logical inconsistencies and unusual trends suggest a moderate probability of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices."}

Similarly, the investing cash flow swung from -183,507 million yen to 287,618 million yen. Such large swings could indicate aggressive accounting practices or unusual transactions.\n\n2. **Unusual Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance increased dramatically from 206,317 million yen in the prior year to 532,484 million yen in the current year. This is inconsistent with the relatively modest operating cash flow and could suggest unreported or unusual sources of cash inflow.\n\n3. **Decline in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees has been steadily declining over the years, from 3,125 four years ago to 2,737 in the current year. While this could be due to operational efficiency, it is worth investigating whether this aligns with the company's reported growth in profits and assets.\n\n4. **Unexplained Gains in Comprehensive Income**: Comprehensive income has increased significantly in the current year (44,865 million yen) compared to the prior year (9,236 million yen). This is a substantial jump and may indicate the inclusion of non-recurring or non-operational items that need further scrutiny.\n\n5. **Negative Goodwill**: The report includes a significant negative goodwill gain of 1,596 million yen in the current year, compared to just 3 million yen in the prior year. Negative goodwill is unusual and could indicate undervalued acquisitions or aggressive accounting.\n\n6. **Low Self-Financing Ratio**: The self-financing ratio (自己資本比率) remains very low, at 3.99% in the current year. This is concerning for a company with such a large asset base and could indicate over-leverage or reliance on external financing.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Trends in Key Metrics**: While net assets and profits have increased, the operating cash flow has not grown proportionally, and the self-financing ratio remains low. This inconsistency could suggest that the reported profits are not fully supported by cash flow generation.\n\n8. **Unusual Changes in Deferred Hedge Gains/Losses**: The deferred hedge gains/losses (繰延ヘッジ損益) increased from 1 million yen in the prior year to 5 million yen in the current year. While the amounts are small, the change is notable and may indicate unusual hedging activities.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, these non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest the possibility of aggressive accounting practices or potential fraud.

However, there are several logical and operational red flags that could suggest potential issues or warrant further investigation: \n\n1. **Declining Financial Health**: The company has been consistently reporting significant losses over the past five years, with negative net income, operating losses, and declining equity. The rapid deterioration of net assets (from 1.4 billion yen to 356 million yen over five years) and cash reserves (from 393 million yen to 35 million yen) is concerning. While this may not directly indicate fraud, it raises questions about the company's sustainability and management practices.\n\n2. **Employee Reduction**: The number of employees has dropped significantly from 54 to 20 over five years. This sharp decline could indicate operational downsizing, financial distress, or potential misrepresentation of workforce data.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The cash flow from investing activities shows a large inflow of 270 million yen three years ago, followed by relatively small and inconsistent amounts in subsequent years. This could indicate one-off transactions or asset sales that may need further scrutiny.\n\n4. **Unclear Asset Write-offs**: The balance sheet shows a significant reduction in total assets, particularly in inventory and investments. The absence of inventory data for the current year ('－') and the sharp decline in investment securities (from 19 million yen to 9 million yen) could suggest asset write-offs or mismanagement.\n\n5. **Unusual Ratios**: The self-capital ratio (自己資本比率) has been declining, and the return on equity (自己資本利益率) shows a sudden positive value in the current year (0.446) despite continued losses. This inconsistency could indicate potential manipulation of financial ratios.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: Several fields, such as potential stock adjustments (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) and interest payments (利息の支払額), are marked as '－' or missing. While this may be due to legitimate reasons, the lack of transparency in these areas could be a red flag.\n\n7. **Tax and Interest Payments**: The company reports zero corporate tax and interest payments in the current year, which may be unusual given its financial activities. This could indicate aggressive tax planning or misreporting.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight significant risks and areas that require further investigation. The combination of declining financial health, operational downsizing, and unusual patterns in cash flow and ratios suggests a moderate probability of fraudulent or misleading reporting."}

This could indicate an accounting anomaly or an attempt to manipulate earnings in a specific year.\n\n2. **Sharp Increase in Depreciation and Amortization (減価償却費及び償却費):** The depreciation and amortization expense nearly doubles from the 'Prior1Year' (41,372,000,000) to the 'CurrentYear' (94,010,000,000). This is unusual unless there was a significant acquisition or change in accounting policy, which is not mentioned in the report.\n\n3. **Significant Increase in Cash Flow from Financing Activities (財務キャッシュフロー):** The cash flow from financing activities jumps from a negative value in the 'Prior1Year' (-115,933,000,000) to a positive value in the 'CurrentYear' (365,396,000,000). This could indicate aggressive financing activities, such as issuing debt or equity, which may not align with the company's overall financial strategy.\n\n4. **Decline in Intangible Assets (無形固定資産):** The intangible assets decrease significantly from the 'Prior1Year' (1,022,112,000,000) to the 'CurrentYear' (880,080,000,000). This could indicate asset write-offs or impairments, which should be explained in the report but are not.\n\n5. **Unusual Tax Adjustments (法人税等調整額):** The tax adjustment flips from a positive value in the 'Prior1Year' (9,268,000,000) to a large negative value in the 'CurrentYear' (-17,562,000,000). This could indicate aggressive tax planning or errors in tax reporting.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Trends in Employee Numbers (従業員数):** The number of employees increases significantly from the 'Prior1Year' (36,902) to the 'CurrentYear' (38,842), despite no corresponding significant increase in revenue or operational scale. This could indicate potential overstatement of employee numbers.\n\n7. **Large Negative Investment Cash Flow (投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー):** The investment cash flow is highly negative in the 'CurrentYear' (-1,455,621,000,000), which is a significant increase in outflows compared to previous years.

These include: \n1. Significant fluctuations in key financial metrics such as '売上高' (Revenue), '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit), and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) over the years. For example, revenue jumped from 852,896,000 in Prior2Year to 4,331,472,000 in Prior1Year, and then slightly increased to 4,372,039,000 in the CurrentYear. Such drastic changes in revenue without a clear explanation could be suspicious.\n2. The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) has been consistently negative over the years, which is unusual for a company reporting significant profits in recent years. This discrepancy between reported profits and negative operating cash flow could indicate earnings manipulation.\n3. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant outflow in the CurrentYear (-547,845,000) compared to prior years, which is not explained in the report. This could indicate unusual or non-transparent investment activities.\n4. The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) shows a large inflow in Prior1Year (1,856,038,000) and a much smaller inflow in the CurrentYear (641,180,000). This could suggest reliance on external financing, which might not be sustainable.\n5. The '従業員数' (Number of Employees) is extremely low (7 in the CurrentYear), which seems inconsistent with the scale of the reported revenue and assets. This could indicate potential misrepresentation of the company's operational scale.\n6. The '棚卸資産の増減額' (Change in Inventory) shows a significant increase in the CurrentYear (-2,057,555,000), which could indicate potential overstatement of inventory or issues with inventory management.\n7. The '法人税等の支払額' (Corporate Tax Payments) shows a reversal from a large outflow in Prior1Year (-170,286,000) to a large inflow in the CurrentYear (167,485,000), which is highly unusual and requires further explanation.\n8. The '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) has fluctuated significantly over the years, with negative values in some years and a relatively low value of 8.89 in the CurrentYear. This inconsistency could indicate market skepticism about the company's reported earnings.\n9. The '現金及び現金同等物の残高' (Cash and Cash Equivalents) decreased significantly in the CurrentYear despite reported profits, which is unusual and could indicate liquidity issues or misrepresentation of cash flows.\n10. The '資本金' (Capital Stock) and '資本剰余金' (Capital Surplus) have increased in the CurrentYear, which could indicate new equity issuance.

This is a 50.6% increase, which is unusually high and not fully explained by the operating cash flow increase (26.7% increase). Such a large jump in cash without a corresponding proportional increase in other financial metrics or clear explanation could be a red flag.\n\n2. **Total Assets and Liabilities**: Both '総資産' (Total Assets) and '負債' (Liabilities) have decreased significantly from the prior year to the current year. Total assets dropped from 67.29 trillion yen to 60.08 trillion yen, and liabilities dropped from 66.98 trillion yen to 59.75 trillion yen. This is a substantial reduction, and while it could be due to asset sales or debt repayment, the report does not provide sufficient context or explanation for such a large change.\n\n3. **Revenue and Profit Trends**: The revenue and profit figures ('税引前利益', '当期利益', etc.) show consistent growth over the years, which is generally a positive sign. However, the growth in profits does not align with the significant changes in cash and total assets/liabilities, raising questions about the underlying financial activities.\n\n4. **Employee Count**: The number of employees ('従業員数') decreased slightly from 1,208 to 1,197 in the current year, despite an increase in profits. While this is not necessarily fraudulent, it is worth noting as it could indicate cost-cutting measures or operational changes that are not detailed in the report.\n\n5. **Consistency in Financial Statements**: The balance sheet ('bs'), profit and loss statement ('pl'), and cash flow statement ('cf') appear consistent from a numerical perspective. However, the lack of detailed explanations for significant changes in key metrics (e.g., cash, total assets, liabilities) is concerning.\n\n6. **Non-Controlling Interests**: The '非支配株主持分' (Non-Controlling Interests) increased slightly from 7.15 billion yen to 7.38 billion yen. This is a minor change and does not raise immediate concerns.\n\nOverall, while the numerical data is consistent, the lack of detailed explanations for significant changes in cash, total assets, and liabilities, combined with the unusually high increase in cash, raises concerns about the transparency of the report.

This is a dramatic jump and is not consistent with the relatively stable trends in other financial metrics such as net income (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益) or revenue-related figures. Such a large increase in operating cash flow without a corresponding increase in profitability could indicate potential manipulation of working capital accounts.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Investment Cash Flow**: The cash flow from investing activities (投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) fluctuates significantly over the years, with a large positive value in the prior year (581 billion yen) turning into a large negative value in the current year (-3.4 trillion yen). While fluctuations in investment cash flow are not uncommon, the magnitude and direction of these changes warrant further scrutiny, especially when combined with the unusual trends in operating cash flow.\n\n3. **Decline in Non-Controlling Interests**: The non-controlling interests (非支配株主持分) decreased significantly from 1.5 trillion yen in the prior year to 1.2 trillion yen in the current year. This could indicate changes in ownership structure or potential write-offs, but the report does not provide sufficient context to explain this change.\n\n4. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The adjustment for corporate taxes (法人税等調整額) shows a significant swing from a negative adjustment (-94 billion yen) in the prior year to a positive adjustment (44.9 billion yen) in the current year. This is unusual and could indicate aggressive tax planning or potential misstatements in tax-related accounts.\n\n5. **Discrepancy in Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income (包括利益) shows significant volatility, with a large drop in the prior year (966 billion yen) compared to the year before (2.06 trillion yen), followed by a slight increase in the current year (984 billion yen). This level of volatility is not consistent with the relatively stable trends in net income and other financial metrics.\n\n6. **Unusual Changes in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**: The allowance for doubtful accounts (貸倒引当金の増減額) shows a significant decrease of 67 billion yen in the current year compared to an increase of 21.6 billion yen in the prior year. This could indicate potential underestimation of bad debts, which would artificially inflate profits.\n\n7. **Land Valuation**: The value of land (土地) decreased significantly from 489 billion yen in the prior year to 424 billion yen in the current year. While this could be due to revaluation or sales, the report does not provide sufficient details to explain this change.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, the above non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest the possibility of aggressive accounting practices or potential misstatements.

This discrepancy suggests that the reported profits are not supported by actual cash generation, which could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or manipulation of earnings.\n\n2. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (tax adjustments) shows a significant negative value (-237,701,000 yen) in the current year, leading to a negative total tax expense (-221,909,000 yen). This is highly unusual and could indicate the use of tax-related adjustments to inflate net income artificially.\n\n3. **Sharp Increase in Borrowings**: The company’s short-term borrowings increased dramatically from 768,574,000 yen in the prior year to 2,779,200,000 yen in the current year. Similarly, long-term borrowings also increased significantly. This could indicate liquidity issues or reliance on debt to fund operations, which is concerning given the negative operating cash flow.\n\n4. **Disappearance of Land Asset**: The '土地' (land) asset, which was valued at 510,498,000 yen in the prior year, is missing ('－') in the current year. This is unusual and raises questions about the disposal or reclassification of this asset, especially since there is no corresponding gain or loss reported in the income statement.\n\n5. **Significant Changes in Deferred Tax Assets**: The '繰延税金資産' (deferred tax assets) increased from 100,705,000 yen to 337,709,000 yen. This sharp increase could indicate aggressive use of deferred tax assets to offset liabilities or inflate net income.\n\n6. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The '有形固定資産' (tangible fixed assets) dropped significantly from 523,847,000 yen to 13,577,000 yen. This drastic reduction is not explained in the report and raises questions about asset disposals or impairments.\n\n7. **Negative Trends in Key Ratios**: The '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) has been declining steadily, from 0.506 four years ago to 0.357 in the current year. This indicates increasing financial leverage and potential solvency risks.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Employee Growth**: The number of employees increased only slightly (from 64 to 65), despite a significant increase in revenue (from 5,774,056,000 yen to 7,496,866,000 yen).

While rapid growth is possible, such a dramatic increase in a single year is unusual and should be corroborated with external market conditions or business developments.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow turned from a significant negative (-1.47 billion yen) in the prior year to a large positive (2.29 billion yen) in the current year. This drastic change is not consistent with the company's historical cash flow trends and should be investigated further.\n\n3. **Significant Increase in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**: The allowance for doubtful accounts increased dramatically from -644,000 yen to -2.9 million yen. This could indicate potential issues with the quality of receivables or aggressive revenue recognition practices.\n\n4. **Large Increase in Short-Term Loans to Related Parties**: The balance sheet shows a new entry for '関係会社短期貸付金' (short-term loans to related parties) of 1.92 billion yen in the current year, which was not present in the prior year. This could indicate potential related-party transactions that may not be at arm's length.\n\n5. **Significant Increase in Tax Expenses**: The tax expense increased from a negative value (-221 million yen) in the prior year to a positive value (366 million yen) in the current year. This could indicate aggressive tax planning or adjustments to prior-year tax provisions.\n\n6. **Unusual Changes in Financing Activities**: The company issued a large amount of long-term debt (4.39 billion yen) while simultaneously repurchasing a significant amount of its own shares (-467 million yen). This combination of activities is unusual and could indicate potential manipulation of financial metrics such as earnings per share.\n\n7. **Negative Investment Cash Flow**: The investment cash flow turned significantly negative (-1.95 billion yen) in the current year, which could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or investments that may not align with the company's core business.\n\n8. **Inconsistencies in Depreciation and Amortization**: The depreciation and amortization expense increased only slightly (from 4.44 million yen to 4.97 million yen), which seems inconsistent with the significant increase in fixed assets and capital expenditures.\n\nWhile these issues do not definitively prove fraud, they raise questions about the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements.

While fluctuations can occur due to market conditions, such drastic changes should be explained in the report, but no such explanation is provided.\n\n2. **Negative Equity in 'Prior4Year'**: The company reported negative equity ('純資産額') in 'Prior4Year', which is a significant red flag. While the situation improved in subsequent years, the lack of explanation for such a critical financial issue raises concerns.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a significant positive value in 'Prior4Year' (9.68 billion yen) but turns negative in 'Prior3Year' and 'CurrentYear'. This inconsistency, especially when compared to the reported profits, could indicate potential manipulation or misclassification of cash flows.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Borrowing**: The company shows a significant increase in long-term borrowing ('長期借入れによる収入') in the 'CurrentYear' (2.1 billion yen) compared to 'Prior1Year' (1.02 billion yen). While this could be legitimate, the lack of context or explanation for such a large increase is concerning.\n\n5. **Negative Retained Earnings**: The company has consistently reported negative retained earnings ('利益剰余金'), which indicates accumulated losses over time. This is a red flag for financial health and sustainability, especially when combined with the other issues.\n\n6. **Unexplained Absence of Data**: Several fields, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' and '特別利益合計' for the 'CurrentYear', are marked as '－' (missing).

This could indicate aggressive tax planning or errors in tax reporting.\n\n8. **Employee Count Decline**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has decreased slightly over the years, which could be a sign of downsizing.

Such large increases in fixed assets should be supported by clear disclosures about acquisitions or construction projects. The absence of such details could indicate potential asset inflation.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash Flow Trends:** While the operating cash flow (営業キャッシュフロー) remains strong and consistent, the investment cash flow (投資キャッシュフロー) shows a significant reduction in outflows from -63.47 billion yen (Prior1Year) to -28.51 billion yen (CurrentYear). This could be due to reduced capital expenditures, but the large change should be explained in the report. Additionally, the financial cash flow (財務キャッシュフロー) turned negative (-7.83 billion yen) after being positive in the prior year (12.66 billion yen). This shift could indicate changes in financing activities, such as debt repayment or reduced borrowing, which should also be clarified.\n\n3. **Decline in Profitability Metrics:** The '自己資本利益率' (ROE) decreased from 8.6% (Prior1Year) to 7.7% (CurrentYear), and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent) under IFRS dropped from 18.15 billion yen (Prior1Year) to 16.15 billion yen (CurrentYear). While these changes are not inherently fraudulent, they may indicate operational challenges or management's inability to sustain prior performance levels. If these declines are not adequately explained, it could raise concerns about the accuracy of reported figures.\n\n4. **Absence of '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted EPS):** The report consistently shows '－' for diluted EPS across all years. If the company has issued convertible securities or stock options, this omission could be misleading. The absence of diluted EPS should be justified.\n\n5. **Unusual Trends in '非支配株主持分' (Non-Controlling Interests):** The non-controlling interests remain relatively flat over the years, increasing only marginally from 43.56 billion yen (Prior2Year) to 43.88 billion yen (CurrentYear). This stability is unusual if the company has subsidiaries with fluctuating performance. Further details about the subsidiaries' contributions would help clarify this.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas where additional disclosures or explanations are necessary to ensure transparency and accuracy."}

This is an unusual and drastic change that is not explained in the report. Such a significant reduction in capital stock could indicate financial restructuring, but without further context, it raises questions.\n\n2. **Negative Operating Cash Flow**: The company has reported negative operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') for the current year (-408,546,000 yen) and prior year (-164,554,000 yen), despite reporting positive net income ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'). This discrepancy between profitability and cash flow could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or issues with receivables collection.\n\n3. **Significant Increase in Borrowings**: The company's short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') increased significantly from 308,603,000 yen in the prior year to 768,574,000 yen in the current year, and long-term borrowings ('長期借入金') decreased drastically from 636,000,000 yen to 107,000,000 yen. Additionally, the current portion of long-term borrowings ('１年内返済予定の長期借入金') increased from 817,247,000 yen to 1,846,600,000 yen. These changes suggest a potential liquidity issue or reliance on debt to finance operations.\n\n4. **Unexplained Increase in '土地' (Land)**: The company reported '土地' (land) as 510,498,000 yen in the current year, whereas it was not reported in the prior year ('－'). This sudden appearance of a significant asset without explanation could indicate asset inflation or misclassification.\n\n5. **Discrepancy in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees increased significantly from 38 in the prior year to 64 in the current year. While this could be due to business expansion, it is not supported by a proportional increase in revenue or other operational metrics, raising questions about the accuracy of this data.\n\n6. **Negative Goodwill ('負ののれん発生益')**: The report mentions a negative goodwill gain of 4,909,000 yen in the current year, which was not present in the prior year. Negative goodwill typically arises from acquiring assets at a price below their fair value, which could indicate undervalued acquisitions or aggressive accounting practices.\n\n7. **Significant Increase in '貸倒引当金' (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts)**: The allowance for doubtful accounts increased significantly from -803,000 yen in the prior year to -1169,000 yen in the current year.

While such growth is not impossible, it is unusually high and warrants further scrutiny, especially in the absence of a clear explanation for this growth.\n\n2. **Decline in Operating Cash Flow Despite Profit Growth**: The operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') remains negative (-29.79 million yen) despite the significant increase in revenue and profitability. This is a red flag, as it suggests that the reported profits may not be supported by actual cash inflows from operations.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Per-Share Data**: The '１株当たり純資産額' (Net Assets Per Share) for 'Prior4Year' is reported as '77708.66', which is an unusually high value compared to subsequent years (e.g., 800.80 in 'Prior3Year'). This discrepancy could indicate a data entry error or manipulation.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Debt Structure**: The company's short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') and long-term borrowings ('長期借入金') have increased significantly, suggesting a heavy reliance on debt financing. This could indicate liquidity issues or an attempt to inflate cash balances.\n\n5. **Negative Self-Financing Ratio**: The self-financing ratio ('自己資本比率') has declined from 0.301 in 'Prior1Year' to 0.277 in the 'CurrentYear', which is concerning given the reported increase in profitability. This suggests that the company is not retaining enough earnings to strengthen its equity base.\n\n6. **Unusual Adjustments in Tax and Special Items**: The '法人税等調整額' (Tax Adjustments) and '特別利益合計' (Extraordinary Gains) show significant changes, which could be used to manipulate net income.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from financing activities ('財務キャッシュフロー') shows a significant decrease compared to the prior year, despite the increase in borrowings. This inconsistency raises questions about the use of borrowed funds.\n\n8. **Unusual Changes in Asset Valuation**: The 'その他有価証券評価差額金' (Other Securities Valuation Difference) shows a significant negative adjustment, which could indicate potential write-downs or asset revaluation issues.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further investigation. The combination of rapid revenue growth, negative operating cash flow, unusual debt changes, and discrepancies in per-share data are significant red flags."}
{"edinet_code": "E04092", "doc_id": "S100LTMW", "label": 0, "prob": 0.7, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report shows several red flags that could indicate potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation. Firstly, there is a significant and sudden deterioration in financial performance, with the company reporting a large negative net income ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') and operating income ('営業利益') in the current year, despite relatively stable performance in prior years. While this could be due to genuine operational challenges, the magnitude of the decline is unusual and should be scrutinized. Secondly, the cash flow from operating activities ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has dropped significantly, which is inconsistent with the large increase in cash and cash equivalents ('現金及び現金同等物の残高'). This discrepancy raises questions about the source of the cash increase, especially since the cash flow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a large inflow, primarily from bond issuance ('社債の発行による収入'). This could indicate that the company is relying heavily on debt to maintain liquidity, which might mask underlying financial issues. Thirdly, the company's equity ('純資産') has decreased significantly, driven by a reduction in retained earnings ('利益剰余金'), which aligns with the reported losses. However, the issuance of bonds and the increase in cash do not seem to fully reconcile with the overall financial picture, suggesting potential misrepresentation or aggressive accounting practices. Lastly, the report includes some missing or unclear data (e.g., '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' and '社債の償還による支出'), which could obscure the true financial position of the company. While these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight inconsistencies and unusual patterns that require further investigation."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Volatility in Key Metrics**: The company's financial performance shows significant volatility, particularly in '経常利益' (ordinary income) and '包括利益' (comprehensive income). For example, '経常利益' swings from a profit of 151,563,000 yen in the prior year to a loss of 150,270,000 yen in the current year. Similarly, '包括利益' shows large fluctuations over the years, which could indicate inconsistent business operations or potential manipulation.\n\n2. **Negative Retained Earnings**: The '利益剰余金' (retained earnings) has turned negative in the current year (-646,267,000 yen), which is a significant deterioration from the prior year (365,726,000 yen). This could indicate financial distress or poor management of profits.\n\n3. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) has increased significantly in the current year (523,131,000 yen) compared to the prior year (394,438,000 yen), despite a significant decline in profitability. This discrepancy between cash flow and profitability could be a red flag for potential earnings management.\n\n4. **High Special Losses**: The '特別損失合計' (total extraordinary losses) has increased dramatically from 472,572,000 yen in the prior year to 1,280,043,000 yen in the current year. This includes a significant increase in '減損損失' (impairment losses), which could be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n5. **Decline in Short-Term Borrowings**: The '短期借入金' (short-term borrowings) has decreased significantly from 5,847,000,000 yen in the prior year to 4,346,600,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate liquidity issues or a shift in financing strategy, which should be further investigated.\n\n6. **Unusual Asset Trends**: The '流動資産' (current assets) has decreased significantly from 1,903,093,000 yen in the prior year to 1,171,060,000 yen in the current year, which could indicate potential liquidity problems or mismanagement of assets.\n\n7. **Lack of Key Metrics**: Several important financial metrics, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share) and '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio), are missing ('－') across all years. While this may be due to the company's specific circumstances, the absence of these metrics could limit transparency and raise concerns.\n\n8. **Significant Impairment Losses**: The '減損損失' (impairment losses) have increased significantly in the current year, which could be a sign of asset overvaluation in prior periods or an attempt to 'clean up' the balance sheet.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that warrant further investigation. The combination of volatile financial performance, unusual cash flow trends, and significant extraordinary losses could indicate potential manipulation or financial distress."}

This could indicate issues with revenue recognition or cash collection practices.\n\n2. **Mismatch Between Profitability and Cash Flow**: While the company reports a net profit, the cash flow from operations is significantly lower, which could suggest aggressive revenue recognition or delayed expense recognition.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Short-Term Borrowings**: The short-term borrowings have increased significantly (6.6 billion yen net increase), which could indicate liquidity issues or reliance on external financing to cover operational shortfalls.\n\n4. **Inventory Build-Up**: Inventory levels have increased substantially (from 10.3 billion yen to 11.8 billion yen), which could indicate overproduction, unsold goods, or potential issues with inventory valuation.\n\n5. **Decline in Accounts Payable**: Accounts payable has decreased significantly (from 15.8 billion yen to 13.6 billion yen), which could indicate early payments to suppliers, potentially to manipulate financial ratios or due to pressure from suppliers.\n\n6. **Unusual Trends in Financial Ratios**: The return on equity (ROE) and operating profit margin have declined significantly, while the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has increased sharply, which could indicate a disconnect between market expectations and actual performance.\n\n7. **No Adjusted EPS Disclosure**: The company has not disclosed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) figures, which is unusual and could indicate a lack of transparency.\n\n8. **Significant Increase in Financing Cash Flow**: The financing cash flow has shifted from a negative 3.4 billion yen to a positive 6.1 billion yen, primarily due to increased borrowings. This could indicate a reliance on debt to sustain operations.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they suggest the need for further investigation into the company's revenue recognition practices, cash flow management, and financial disclosures."}

This is primarily driven by a reduction in short-term borrowings and an increase in dividend payments. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it warrants further investigation to ensure the company is not masking liquidity issues.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The short-term borrowings (短期借入金) increased significantly from 10,125,000,000 JPY in the prior year to 14,645,000,000 JPY in the current year, while long-term borrowings (長期借入金) decreased from 10,782,000,000 JPY to 5,150,000,000 JPY. This shift in debt structure could be a strategic decision, but it is worth verifying the rationale behind this change.\n\n3. **Reduction in Treasury Stock (自己株式)**: The treasury stock value decreased significantly from -2,489,000,000 JPY to -889,000,000 JPY. This could indicate a significant sale of treasury shares, which should be cross-verified with disclosures to ensure proper reporting and compliance.\n\n4. **Special Gains and Losses**: The special gains (特別利益合計) increased from 558,000,000 JPY to 640,000,000 JPY, while special losses (特別損失合計) also increased from 206,000,000 JPY to 361,000,000 JPY. The increase in special losses is primarily due to a reduction in impairment losses (減損損失) to zero. This could be legitimate, but it is worth verifying the basis for these changes.\n\n5. **Consistency in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The balance sheet shows a decrease in cash and deposits (現金及び預金) from 12,096,000,000 JPY to 11,410,000,000 JPY, while cash and cash equivalents (現金及び現金同等物) increased from 19,996,000,000 JPY to 20,710,000,000 JPY.

This could indicate potential issues with revenue recognition or working capital management.\n\n2. **Significant Increase in '未収入金' (Accounts Receivable)**: The '未収入金' has increased substantially from 147,975,000 to 262,078,000. This could suggest aggressive revenue recognition practices or potential collection issues.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Profitability Metrics**: The operating profit ('営業利益') has dropped significantly from 243,491,000 to 117,598,000, while the net income ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') has remained stable. This discrepancy is partially explained by the significant increase in '特別利益合計' (Extraordinary Income), which includes gains from the sale of investment securities and compensation for relocation. Reliance on non-operating or extraordinary income to maintain profitability could be a red flag.\n\n4. **Decline in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees has been decreasing steadily over the years, from 361 to 323. While this could be due to operational efficiency, it may also indicate potential downsizing or financial stress.\n\n5. **Unusual Extraordinary Income**: The '移転補償金' (Relocation Compensation) and '投資有価証券売却益' (Gains on Sale of Investment Securities) have significantly contributed to the extraordinary income. While these are legitimate sources of income, their one-time nature raises questions about the sustainability of the company's profitability.\n\n6. **Negative Trends in Cash Flow from Financing Activities**: The company has consistently reported negative cash flow from financing activities, which could indicate a reliance on debt repayment or a lack of new financing. This is not inherently fraudulent but warrants further investigation into the company's financial strategy.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation to rule out potential manipulation or aggressive accounting practices."}

While this could be due to legitimate reasons such as increased operational efficiency or one-time gains, the magnitude of the increase is notable and should be cross-verified with operational and market conditions.\n\n2. **Fixed Asset Sale Gains**: The '固定資産売却益' (Gain on Sale of Fixed Assets) shows a large one-time gain of 506,548,000 yen in the current year, which significantly contributes to the increase in net income. This could be a legitimate transaction, but it is worth verifying the nature of the sale, the valuation of the assets sold, and whether this is a recurring or one-time event.\n\n3. **Investment Cash Flow Turnaround**: The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant positive turnaround from -479,815,000 yen in the prior year to 171,592,000 yen in the current year. This is unusual and could indicate asset sales or other significant changes in investment activities. The details of these transactions should be reviewed to ensure they are legitimate.\n\n4. **Unusual Decrease in Interest Income**: The '受取利息' (Interest Income) dropped significantly from 17,908,000 yen in the prior year to 3,083,000 yen in the current year. This could be due to changes in interest rates or a reduction in interest-bearing assets, but it is worth investigating further.\n\n5. **No Adjusted EPS Data**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Adjusted EPS) is missing ('－') for all years. While this may not necessarily indicate fraud, it is unusual for a company to not report this metric, especially if there are potential dilutive securities.\n\n6. **Increase in Deferred Tax Liabilities**: The '繰延税金負債' (Deferred Tax Liabilities) increased from 251,100,000 yen to 283,625,000 yen. This could be due to changes in tax laws or accounting adjustments, but it is worth verifying the underlying reasons.\n\n7. **Consistency in Financial Activities Cash Flow**: The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) remains unchanged at -55,402,000 yen for multiple years. While this is not inherently suspicious, it is unusual for financing activities to show no variation over time and should be reviewed for accuracy.\n\nOverall, while there are no definitive signs of fraud, the significant changes in net income, cash flows, and one-time gains warrant further scrutiny to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of the reported figures."}

The company's '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a significant positive value in the current year (914,040,000 yen) compared to the prior year (279,841,000 yen). This is unusual as investing activities typically result in cash outflows, not inflows. The source of this inflow should be clarified, especially since the '有形固定資産の売却による収入' (proceeds from the sale of tangible fixed assets) and '投資有価証券の売却による収入' (proceeds from the sale of investment securities) are relatively small.\n\n2. The '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) has been steadily declining over the years, from 0.747 four years ago to 0.661 in the current year. While this is not necessarily fraudulent, it could indicate increasing reliance on debt or other liabilities, which may warrant further scrutiny.\n\n3. The '現金及び現金同等物の増減額' (net increase in cash and cash equivalents) is significantly high in the current year (1,302,802,000 yen). This is primarily driven by the positive cash flow from investing activities, which, as mentioned earlier, is unusual and should be investigated further.\n\n4. The '減価償却費及び償却費' (depreciation and amortization expenses) have decreased significantly from 186,935,000 yen in the prior year to 130,108,000 yen in the current year. This could be due to the disposal of assets or changes in accounting estimates, but it should be verified.\n\n5. The '特別利益合計' (total extraordinary income) has dropped significantly from 268,274,000 yen in the prior year to 16,249,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate a one-time gain in the prior year that is not recurring, but the nature of these extraordinary items should be reviewed.\n\n6. The '自己株式の取得による支出' (expenditure for the acquisition of treasury stock) has decreased significantly from 415,625,000 yen in the prior year to 78,301,000 yen in the current year.

While such a turnaround is possible, it warrants scrutiny, especially since there is no clear explanation provided for this drastic improvement.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance in the balance sheet (56.58 billion yen) does not align with the cash flow statement (54.93 billion yen). This inconsistency could indicate errors or intentional misstatements.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Financing Activities**: The financial cash flow shows a significant improvement from -77.76 billion yen in the prior year to 2.06 billion yen in the current year. This is primarily driven by a large increase in long-term borrowings and a reduction in short-term borrowings. However, the rationale for such a shift is not explained, and the sustainability of this financing strategy is unclear.\n\n4. **Negative Retained Earnings in Prior Years**: The company reported negative operating cash flows for several years, yet retained earnings have consistently increased. This could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or other accounting irregularities.\n\n5. **Unexplained Tax Adjustments**: The corporate tax adjustment amount has shifted from a significant negative value (-6.97 billion yen) in the prior year to a positive value (1.44 billion yen) in the current year. This change is not explained and could indicate tax-related manipulations.\n\n6. **Unusual Trends in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees has decreased slightly (from 2,218 to 2,189), while temporary employees have decreased more significantly (from 317 to 275). This is unusual given the significant improvement in profitability and cash flow, as one would expect the workforce to expand in such a scenario.\n\n7. **Lack of Disclosure for Key Metrics**: Certain key metrics, such as diluted earnings per share and price-to-earnings ratio, are not disclosed ('－'). While this could be due to legitimate reasons, the lack of transparency is concerning.\n\n8. **Unusual Changes in Depreciation and Amortization**: The accumulated depreciation has increased significantly (from -6.46 billion yen to -8.49 billion yen), but there is no corresponding increase in tangible or intangible fixed assets to justify this change.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation.

While this alone is not indicative of fraud, it raises concerns about the company's sustainability and management practices.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The cash flow from operating activities shows significant fluctuations, including a large negative value two years ago, followed by a small positive value in the current year. This inconsistency could indicate aggressive accounting practices or operational inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Significant Changes in Inventory and Payables**: The increase in inventory and accounts payable in the current year is notable. While this could be due to operational reasons, it may also suggest potential manipulation to inflate assets or delay expense recognition.\n\n4. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The report shows significant gains and losses from the sale and valuation of investment securities. This could indicate reliance on non-operational income to offset operational losses, which might be a red flag if done repeatedly or strategically.\n\n5. **Negative Equity Trends**: The company's retained earnings have been negative for several years, and the deficit has been growing. This suggests that the company has been consistently unprofitable, which could lead to financial distress and potential pressure to manipulate financial results.\n\n6. **Lack of Disclosure on Certain Items**: The absence of data for '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share) and '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio) raises questions about transparency.

The current year shows a significant loss in net income (当期純利益又は当期純損失) and a sharp drop in net assets. While this could be due to genuine operational challenges, the magnitude and consistency of the decline warrant further scrutiny.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Inventory and Receivables**: The balance sheet shows a significant reduction in inventory (商品及び製品, 原材料及び貯蔵品) and an increase in receivables (受取手形及び売掛金). This could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or issues with inventory management. The sharp increase in receivables, despite declining revenue, is particularly concerning.\n\n3. **Large Adjustments in Allowances**: The allowance for doubtful accounts (貸倒引当金) shows a significant increase in the current year, which could indicate a sudden realization of uncollectible receivables. This raises questions about the quality of the receivables and whether they were accurately reported in prior periods.\n\n4. **Unusual Cash Flow Patterns**: The cash flow statement shows a significant inflow from investing activities in the prior year, primarily due to the sale of investment securities (投資有価証券の売却による収入). However, the current year shows a sharp decline in investment cash flow and a significant outflow in operating cash flow. This could indicate reliance on asset sales to cover operational losses, which is not sustainable in the long term.\n\n5. **Decline in Investment Securities**: The value of investment securities (投資有価証券) has dropped significantly, which could indicate either a sale of assets to generate cash or a write-down of asset values. This aligns with the earlier observation of reliance on asset sales.\n\n6. **Negative Equity Trends**: The retained earnings (利益剰余金) have turned negative, and the equity ratio (自己資本比率) has declined significantly, indicating financial distress. The company’s ability to sustain operations in the long term is questionable.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Employee Trends**: While the number of employees (従業員数) has increased, the average number of temporary employees (平均臨時雇用人員) has decreased. This could indicate a shift in workforce strategy, but it is inconsistent with the declining financial performance and raises questions about cost management.\n\n8. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The income statement shows significant gains from the sale of investment securities (投資有価証券売却益) and unusual losses such as impairment losses (減損損失) and valuation losses on investment securities (投資有価証券評価損). These items could be used to manipulate earnings.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they indicate potential issues that warrant further investigation.

However, this improvement is not reflected in the '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders), which remains negative. This discrepancy could indicate aggressive accounting practices or one-time adjustments to inflate ordinary profit.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) has improved significantly in the current year, despite the company still reporting a net loss. This could indicate potential manipulation of working capital accounts, such as accounts receivable or inventory, to artificially boost operating cash flow.\n\n3. **Asset and Liability Management**: The company's '純資産額' (net assets) has been declining steadily, and the '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) has dropped to 0.251, indicating a weakening financial position. Despite this, the company has increased its '短期借入金' (short-term borrowings) significantly, which could be a sign of liquidity issues.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: There are notable changes in certain accounts, such as a significant decrease in 'リース資産' (lease assets) and '投資有価証券' (investment securities), which could indicate asset sales or write-downs. Additionally, the '貸倒引当金' (allowance for doubtful accounts) has decreased, which could be an attempt to improve profitability artificially.\n\n5. **Non-Disclosure of Key Metrics**: Certain key metrics, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) and '株価収益率' (P/E ratio), are not disclosed, which could limit transparency and make it harder to assess the company's true financial health.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Trends in Cash Flow Statements**: The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a positive figure in the current year, which is unusual given the company's declining financial position.

Such a significant change in financing activities without a clear explanation could be a red flag.\n\n5. **Decline in Comprehensive Income (包括利益)**: Comprehensive income decreased from 2,349,498,000 yen in the prior year to 2,183,876,000 yen in the current year, despite an increase in net income. This could indicate unrealized losses or other adjustments that are not fully explained.\n\n6. **Unexplained Changes in Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities (繰延税金資産, 繰延税金負債)**: Deferred tax assets decreased from 87,485,000 yen to 75,465,000 yen, and deferred tax liabilities increased from 58,478,000 yen to 72,365,000 yen. These changes are not explained and could indicate tax-related adjustments or issues.\n\n7. **Significant Increase in Accounts Payable (買掛金)**: Accounts payable increased significantly from 3,255,031,000 yen in the prior year to 4,161,299,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate delayed payments to suppliers, which might be used to manage cash flow artificially.\n\n8. **Unusual Decrease in Intangible Fixed Assets (無形固定資産)**: Intangible fixed assets decreased significantly from 41,965,000 yen in the prior year to 29,237,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate asset write-offs or impairments that are not fully disclosed.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise questions about the company's financial practices and warrant further investigation."}

This discrepancy between profitability and cash flow could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or issues with receivables collection.\n\n2. **Significant Fluctuations in Borrowing**: The short-term borrowings show a significant swing from a decrease of -1.72 trillion yen in the prior year to an increase of 83.99 billion yen in the current year. Similarly, long-term borrowings increased significantly (810 billion yen in the current year). These large fluctuations in financing activities could indicate liquidity issues or reliance on debt to sustain operations.\n\n3. **Low Equity Ratio**: The company's equity ratio remains extremely low (0.9% in the current year), which is unusual and suggests that the company is heavily leveraged. This could indicate financial instability or an over-reliance on debt financing.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Employee Numbers**: The number of employees and temporary workers shows significant fluctuations over the years (e.g., temporary workers decreased from 4,711 four years ago to 630 in the current year). Such drastic changes in workforce numbers could indicate operational instability or potential misreporting.\n\n5. **Unusual Trends in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**: The allowance for doubtful accounts increased significantly from -1.57 billion yen in the prior year to -2.11 billion yen in the current year. This could indicate potential issues with the quality of receivables or an attempt to manipulate earnings.\n\n6. **Discrepancy in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents balance has been declining steadily (e.g., 408.85 billion yen two years ago to 290.03 billion yen in the current year), despite the company reporting positive net income. This could indicate cash flow management issues or potential misrepresentation of cash flows.\n\n7. **Unusual Trends in Investment Cash Flows**: The investment cash flows show a significant positive value two years ago (52.99 billion yen) compared to negative values in other years. This inconsistency could indicate one-off transactions or potential misclassification of cash flows.\n\n8. **Lack of Adjusted EPS Data**: The absence of adjusted EPS data (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) for all years is unusual and could indicate a lack of transparency in reporting.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, these non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest the possibility of financial misrepresentation or aggressive accounting practices. Further investigation, including a detailed review of the company's accounting policies and practices, is recommended."}
{"edinet_code": "E05349", "doc_id": "S10079DH", "label": 1, "prob": 0.7, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report contains several red flags that could indicate potential fraudulent activities or at least significant financial distress. Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Revenue Drop**: The company's revenue ('売上高') has dropped drastically from 346,308,000 in the prior year to 104,446,000 in the current year, a decline of approximately 70%. This is a significant drop and is not accompanied by any explanation in the report. Such a sharp decline without context could indicate mismanagement, fraud, or a failure to disclose critical information.\n\n2. **Consistent Losses**: The company has been reporting consistent and increasing losses ('経常利益', '包括利益', '当期純利益又は当期純損失') over the years. The current year's net loss ('当期純利益又は当期純損失') is -618,734,000, which is almost double the prior year's loss of -356,651,000. This trend of worsening financial performance raises concerns about the company's viability and whether the losses are being accurately reported.\n\n3. **Asset and Equity Decline**: The total assets ('総資産額') and net assets ('純資産額') have significantly decreased. Total assets dropped from 980,142,000 to 434,225,000, and net assets fell from 908,784,000 to 396,131,000. This indicates a substantial erosion of the company's financial position, which is not adequately explained in the report.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') improved from -322,825,000 to -167,236,000, but this improvement is inconsistent with the worsening net losses. Additionally, the company continues to generate positive financing cash flows ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー'), suggesting reliance on external funding despite its deteriorating financial health. This could indicate an attempt to mask liquidity issues.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: There are significant changes in certain balance sheet accounts, such as '売掛金' (accounts receivable) dropping from 259,025,000 to 35,319,000 and '貸倒引当金' (allowance for doubtful accounts) being removed entirely. These changes are not explained and could indicate aggressive accounting practices or misstatements.\n\n6. **Employee Count**: The number of employees ('従業員数') dropped from 29 to 17 in the current year, which aligns with the revenue decline but also raises questions about the company's operational capacity and whether it is downsizing to an unsustainable level.\n\n7. **Unexplained Items**: Several items in the report are marked as '－' (missing or not applicable), such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' and '自己資本利益率、経営指標等'. While this may be due to the nature of the company, the lack of data in these areas makes it difficult to fully assess the company's financial health.\n\n8. **Special Gains and Losses**: The prior year included a significant special gain ('特別利益合計') of 981,318,000, which is absent in the current year. This suggests that the prior year's results may have been artificially inflated by one-time gains, masking the underlying financial issues.\n\n9. **Valuation Concerns**: The company's equity per share ('１株当たり純資産額') has dropped from 31.27 to 12.57, reflecting the erosion of shareholder value. This, combined with the lack of profitability, raises concerns about the company's valuation and its ability to attract investors.\n\nOverall, the report shows signs of financial distress, potential mismanagement, and unexplained discrepancies. While these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they warrant further investigation."}
{"edinet_code": "E05356", "doc_id": "S100SP1B", "label": 0, "prob": 0.7, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report does not contain any glaring numerical inconsistencies, as the data has been verified by a certified public accountant. However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Significant Decline in Profitability**: The company has reported a sharp decline in profitability, with the '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) turning from a positive ¥232,916,000 in the prior year to a significant loss of ¥-718,274,000 in the current year. This is accompanied by a large increase in '特別損失合計' (Extraordinary Losses), primarily due to '減損損失' (Impairment Losses) of ¥268,957,000. While impairment losses can be legitimate, they are sometimes used to manipulate earnings or hide operational inefficiencies.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash Flow Trends**: Despite the significant net loss, the company reports a strong positive '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) of ¥1,130,391,000 in the current year, compared to a negative ¥-369,855,000 in the prior year. This sharp reversal in cash flow trends is unusual and warrants further investigation, as it could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting maneuvers.\n\n3. **Decline in Equity and Asset Base**: The company's '純資産' (Net Assets) and '総資産' (Total Assets) have both declined significantly, with net assets dropping from ¥3,922,191,000 to ¥3,095,966,000 and total assets decreasing from ¥10,682,349,000 to ¥9,193,495,000. This decline is concerning, especially when combined with the reported losses and impairment charges.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Employee Numbers**: The '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) has fluctuated significantly over the years, dropping from 189 in the prior year to 126 in the current year. While this could be due to operational restructuring, such fluctuations may also indicate attempts to manipulate labor costs or other operational metrics.\n\n5. **Omission of Key Data**: Certain fields, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) and '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio), are missing or represented as '－'. While this could be due to legitimate reasons (e.g., no diluted shares or negative earnings), the lack of transparency in these areas raises questions.\n\n6. **High Extraordinary Losses**: The extraordinary losses in the current year are significantly higher than in the prior year, primarily due to impairment losses. This could indicate poor asset management or an attempt to 'clean up' the balance sheet in a single year, which is a common tactic in earnings management.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Financial Strategy**: The company has reduced its '長期借入金' (Long-Term Borrowings) and '社債' (Corporate Bonds) significantly, while also reporting a decline in '自己株式' (Treasury Stock). This could indicate financial distress or a shift in financial strategy, but the lack of accompanying narrative makes it difficult to assess the rationale behind these changes.\n\nWhile none of these issues individually confirm fraudulent activity, the combination of significant losses, unusual cash flow trends, and a lack of transparency in certain areas raises concerns. Further investigation, including a review of the company's accounting policies and operational practices, is recommended."}

Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Significant Decline in Operating Cash Flow**: The operating cash flow has turned sharply negative in the current year (-569,576,000) compared to consistently positive values in prior years. This is inconsistent with the reported net income, which remains positive (albeit lower). A negative operating cash flow alongside positive net income could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or manipulation of working capital accounts.\n\n2. **Unusual Increase in '未収入金' (Accounts Receivable)**: The '未収入金' (accounts receivable) has increased dramatically from 3,208,000 in the prior year to 557,094,000 in the current year. This could suggest potential revenue inflation, as the company may be recognizing revenue without actual cash collection.\n\n3. **Sharp Decline in '投資有価証券' (Investment Securities)**: The value of '投資有価証券' (investment securities) has dropped significantly from 1,965,939,000 in the prior year to 871,067,000 in the current year. While this could be due to legitimate sales or valuation adjustments, the corresponding gain from the sale of investment securities (295,017,000) appears unusually high and could be used to offset losses elsewhere.\n\n4. **Negative Comprehensive Income ('包括利益')**: The comprehensive income has turned sharply negative (-647,787,000) in the current year, despite a positive net income attributable to parent company shareholders (83,052,000). This discrepancy could indicate significant unrealized losses, possibly related to investment securities or foreign exchange adjustments, which are not fully explained in the report.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in '評価・換算差額等' (Valuation and Translation Adjustments)**: The '評価・換算差額等' (valuation and translation adjustments) has shifted from a positive 479,750,000 in the prior year to a negative -246,761,000 in the current year. This large swing could indicate potential issues with the valuation of assets or liabilities, which may not have been adequately disclosed.\n\n6. **Sharp Decline in Total Assets and Equity**: Both total assets and equity have declined significantly in the current year. Total assets dropped from 7,470,165,000 to 6,277,443,000, and equity dropped from 6,164,242,000 to 5,420,490,000. While this could be due to legitimate reasons, the lack of detailed explanations raises concerns.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Trends in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees has increased from 250 to 262, while average temporary employees have decreased from 69 to 59. This inconsistency could indicate potential misreporting of labor costs or headcount.\n\n8. **Unusual Gains from Asset Sales**: The company reported significant gains from the sale of fixed assets (50,282,000) and investment securities (295,017,000). These one-time gains could be used to mask underlying operational weaknesses.\n\n9. **Negative Trends in Key Financial Ratios**: The return on equity (ROE) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio have deteriorated significantly over the years, indicating declining profitability and investor confidence. The ROE has dropped from 7.0% four years ago to 1.4% in the current year, and the P/E ratio remains high at 47.1, suggesting overvaluation or poor earnings quality.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest potential issues that could indicate fraudulent activities or at least require further investigation."}

This is a dramatic growth of over 100%, which is not supported by a corresponding increase in operating cash flow or other business activities. The operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') remains relatively stable, and the financial cash flow ('財務キャッシュフロー') shows a large positive inflow, which could indicate unusual financing activities. This discrepancy raises questions about the source of the cash increase.\n\n2. **Decline in Profitability Despite Revenue Growth**: The '売上高' (Revenue) has increased over the years, but the '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) has significantly declined from 8,227,000,000 yen in the prior year to 3,324,000,000 yen in the current year. This decline in profitability, despite stable or growing revenue, could indicate issues with cost management, potential misclassification of expenses, or other operational inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Comprehensive Income**: The '当期包括利益: 親会社の所有者に帰属（IFRS）' (Comprehensive Income Attributable to Parent Company Owners) has also declined significantly from 7,928,000,000 yen in the prior year to 4,441,000,000 yen in the current year. This aligns with the decline in net income but raises questions about the company's ability to generate value for shareholders.\n\n4. **Unusual Financial Cash Flow**: The '財務キャッシュフロー' (Financial Cash Flow) shows a significant positive inflow of 26,905,000,000 yen in the current year, compared to a negative outflow of 3,207,000,000 yen in the prior year. This sudden shift could indicate aggressive financing activities, such as issuing debt or equity, which may not be sustainable or could be masking underlying financial issues.\n\n5. **Employee Count Growth**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has grown significantly from 45,408 four years ago to 93,028 in the current year. While this could indicate business expansion, the rapid growth in headcount does not seem to align with the declining profitability and raises questions about the efficiency of resource utilization.\n\n6. **Negative Investment Cash Flow**: The '投資キャッシュフロー' (Investment Cash Flow) remains negative, which is typical for a growing company. However, the lack of detailed information about the nature of these investments makes it difficult to assess whether these expenditures are generating adequate returns.\n\n7. **High Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)**: The '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) of 95.6 four years ago is unusually high, suggesting that the company's stock may have been overvalued at that time. While this is historical data, it could indicate a pattern of overvaluation or market manipulation.\n\n8. **Missing Data**: Several data points are missing or represented as '-', such as '社債の償還による支出' (Redemption of Bonds). While this could be due to parsing errors, it raises concerns about the completeness and transparency of the report.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, the above points suggest potential red flags that warrant further investigation. The unusual growth in cash and cash equivalents, combined with declining profitability and significant changes in financial cash flow, are particularly concerning."}

This is highly unusual unless there was a major acquisition or expansion, which is not mentioned in the report. Such a sharp increase in headcount should typically be accompanied by a proportional increase in operational costs or revenues, which is not evident here.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Profit Trends**: While the operating profit (営業利益) and pre-tax profit (税引前利益) increased significantly, the net profit attributable to parent company shareholders (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益) dropped drastically from 1.91 billion yen in the prior year to 832 million yen in the current year. This is inconsistent with the trend of increasing revenues and operating profits and raises questions about the accuracy of expense reporting or the presence of unusual one-time charges.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The cash flow from financing activities (財務キャッシュフロー) swung dramatically from a positive 26.9 billion yen in the prior year to a negative 25.9 billion yen in the current year. This is a significant shift and is not adequately explained in the report. Additionally, the issuance and redemption of corporate bonds (社債) show unusual activity, with a 2 billion yen issuance and a 6.26 billion yen redemption, which could indicate potential liquidity issues or aggressive financial engineering.\n\n4. **Inventory Changes**: The increase in inventory (棚卸資産の増減額) is notable, with a larger negative value in the current year (-881 million yen) compared to the prior year (-135 million yen). This could indicate overproduction, unsold goods, or potential mismanagement of inventory, which might be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n5. **Discrepancy in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents decreased significantly by 33.3 billion yen in the current year, despite a positive operating cash flow of 28.8 billion yen. This suggests that the company might be facing liquidity issues or engaging in aggressive investment or financing activities that are not clearly justified.\n\n6. **Unusual Increase in Intangible Assets**: The intangible fixed assets (無形固定資産) increased significantly from 24.6 billion yen in the prior year to 35.4 billion yen in the current year. This is a 44% increase and could indicate potential overvaluation of intangible assets, such as goodwill, which might be used to inflate the balance sheet.\n\n7. **Mismatch in Revenue and Profit Growth**: The revenue (売上総利益) increased significantly, but the net profit attributable to parent company shareholders (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益) decreased. This mismatch could indicate issues with cost management, unusual expenses, or potential manipulation of profit figures.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, these logical inconsistencies and unusual trends suggest the possibility of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices.

This is inconsistent with the '非支配株主持分' (Non-controlling interests in equity) in the balance sheet, which also decreased significantly from 6,634,000,000 to 4,264,000,000. While such changes can occur due to divestitures or changes in ownership structure, no explanation is provided in the summary.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Profit Growth vs. Cash Flow Trends:** The '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net income attributable to parent company shareholders) increased dramatically from 664,000,000 to 10,207,000,000, a nearly 15-fold increase. However, the operating cash flow ('営業キャッシュフロー') decreased slightly from 28,872,000,000 to 26,665,000,000. Such a mismatch between profit growth and cash flow trends could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting manipulations.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities and Equity:** The total liabilities ('負債') increased significantly from 279,481,000,000 to 315,580,000,000, while the equity attributable to parent company shareholders ('資本剰余金' and '利益剰余金') increased only modestly. This could suggest an over-reliance on debt financing without a proportional increase in retained earnings or capital surplus.\n\n4. **Missing Data in Financing Activities:** The '社債の発行による収入' (Proceeds from bond issuance) is missing ('－') for the current year, while the '社債の償還による支出' (Repayment of bonds) is significantly lower than the prior year. This lack of clarity in financing activities could obscure the company's true financial position.\n\n5. **Significant Increase in Comprehensive Income:** The '当期包括利益: 親会社の所有者に帰属' (Comprehensive income attributable to parent company owners) increased from 6,010,000,000 to 16,684,000,000, which is a substantial jump. This increase is not fully explained by the changes in net income or other components of the financial statements.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise questions about the company's financial reporting practices and warrant further investigation."}

This rapid increase in workforce is not accompanied by a proportional increase in revenue or profitability, which could indicate misreporting of employee numbers or other operational inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from financing activities (財務キャッシュフロー) shows a drastic shift from a positive 32,442,000,000 (Prior1Year) to a negative -3,207,000,000 (CurrentYear). This sudden reversal is not explained in the data and could indicate unusual financial maneuvers or misreporting.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Asset and Liability Growth**: The total assets (総資産) and liabilities (負債) have grown significantly from the prior year, with liabilities increasing from 125,484,000,000 to 174,186,000,000. However, the growth in equity (純資産) does not appear to align proportionally, which could suggest aggressive leveraging or misrepresentation of liabilities.\n\n4. **Unusual Depreciation Expense**: The depreciation and amortization expense (減価償却費及び償却費) has increased dramatically from 3,672,000,000 (Prior1Year) to 10,762,000,000 (CurrentYear). This sharp increase is not consistent with the relatively stable levels of tangible and intangible fixed assets, raising questions about the accuracy of reported expenses.\n\n5. **Negative Investment Cash Flow**: The investment cash flow (投資キャッシュフロー) has been consistently negative over the years, with no clear explanation or corresponding growth in assets or revenue. This could indicate mismanagement of funds or misreporting.\n\n6. **Unexplained Changes in Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income attributable to parent company shareholders (当期包括利益: 親会社の所有者に帰属) shows significant fluctuations, particularly between Prior2Year (8,366,000,000) and Prior1Year (4,849,000,000), and then a sharp increase to 8,065,000,000 (CurrentYear). These large swings are not clearly explained by the operational or financial data provided.\n\n7. **Discrepancy in Equity Metrics**: The equity per share (１株当たり純資産額) and earnings per share (１株当たり当期純利益) show inconsistent trends that do not align with the reported growth in net income or equity, suggesting potential misreporting of share-related metrics.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, these logical inconsistencies and unexplained trends raise concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the reported data.

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Unusual Fluctuations in Key Metrics**: The company's '経常利益' (ordinary profit) and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders) show a dramatic turnaround from consistent losses in prior years to significant profits in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, such a sharp reversal warrants further investigation, especially given the lack of a clear explanation for this improvement in the report.\n\n2. **Significant Changes in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**: The '貸倒引当金の増減額' (allowance for doubtful accounts) shows a massive decrease of -544,908,000 yen in the current year. This is an unusually large adjustment and could indicate aggressive accounting practices to inflate profits.\n\n3. **Discrepancies in Cash Flow Trends**: The '営業キャッシュフロー' (operating cash flow) dropped significantly from 771,595,000 yen in the prior year to 33,060,000 yen in the current year, despite the reported increase in profits. This disconnect between cash flow and profitability is a potential red flag, as it suggests that the reported profits may not be supported by actual cash generation.\n\n4. **Unexplained Special Gains and Losses**: The '特別利益合計' (extraordinary gains) and '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) show significant amounts in the current year (189,857,000 yen and 181,319,000 yen, respectively), but there is no detailed explanation provided for these items. This lack of transparency could be an attempt to obscure the true financial performance of the company.\n\n5. **Decline in Fixed Assets and Intangible Assets**: The '有形固定資産' (tangible fixed assets) and '無形固定資産' (intangible fixed assets) have decreased significantly in the current year. While this could be due to asset sales or impairments, the report does not provide sufficient details to confirm this.\n\n6. **Inconsistencies in Inventory Reporting**: The '商品及び製品' (merchandise and finished goods) dropped dramatically from 116,895,000 yen in the prior year to 332,000 yen in the current year. Such a sharp decline in inventory without a corresponding explanation is unusual and could indicate issues with inventory management or reporting.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The '長期借入金' (long-term borrowings) increased significantly from 18,183,000 yen in the prior year to 70,786,000 yen in the current year. This increase in debt, combined with the other red flags, could indicate financial strain or an attempt to manipulate financial ratios.\n\n8. **Lack of Transparency in Key Areas**: Several items in the report are marked as '－' (missing or not applicable), including '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share) for prior years and '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio) for prior years. While this may be due to data limitations, it reduces the overall transparency of the report.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight several areas of concern that warrant further investigation.

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow shows a dramatic swing from a significant negative value (-939,387,000) in the prior year to a large positive value (771,595,000) in the current year. This is a drastic change that warrants further investigation, as such a shift is uncommon without a clear explanation. \n\n2. **Discrepancy in Profitability vs. Cash Flow**: Despite the significant improvement in operating cash flow, the company continues to report a net loss (-32,652,000). This inconsistency between cash flow and profitability could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or other accounting manipulations.\n\n3. **Unexplained Changes in Assets**: The cash and cash equivalents have increased significantly from 635,259,000 to 1,570,008,000, which is a substantial jump. This increase is not fully explained by the cash flow statement, as the financing cash flow is relatively small (22,960,000) and the investment cash flow is positive but not large enough to account for the increase.\n\n4. **Unusual Tax Payments**: The company reports a significant increase in tax payments (45,687,000) despite reporting a net loss. This is counterintuitive and raises questions about the nature of these tax payments.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Trends in Revenue and Profitability**: While revenue has increased significantly (from 2,968,591,000 to 3,598,007,000), the company has not been able to translate this into profitability, as it continues to report losses. This could indicate issues with cost management or potential revenue inflation.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: There are several instances of missing data (e.g., '－' for diluted earnings per share and other metrics). While this could be due to parsing errors, it is important to verify whether this data was intentionally omitted.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The company reports a new long-term borrowing (18,183,000) in the current year, which was not present in the prior year. This sudden change in financing strategy should be investigated further.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they suggest the need for a deeper investigation into the company's financial practices and disclosures."}

However, there are a few points worth noting: \n1. The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted earnings per share) is consistently missing ('－') across all years. While this could be due to the company not having any dilutive securities, it is unusual for a company to not report this metric at all, especially if it has been publicly traded for multiple years. \n2. The '減損損失' (Impairment loss) is reported as '－' in the prior year but shows a value in the current year. This is not inherently fraudulent but warrants further investigation to understand the nature of the impairment and why it was not present in prior years. \n3. The '短期借入金の純増減額' (Net change in short-term borrowings) shows a significant decrease in the current year (-100 million yen) compared to a large increase in the prior year (430 million yen). While this could be a strategic financial decision, it is worth verifying the rationale behind such a shift. \n4. The '法人税等の支払額' (Corporate tax payments) shows a significant decrease in the current year compared to the prior year, despite an increase in profits. This could be due to tax planning or deferred tax adjustments, but it should be reviewed to ensure compliance with tax regulations. \n5. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash flow from investing activities) shows a consistent outflow, which is typical for many companies, but the magnitude of the outflow in the current year (-116 million yen) is higher than in the prior year (-68.9 million yen). This could indicate increased investment activity, which should be aligned with the company's strategic goals. \n6. The '自己株式の取得による支出' (Expenditure for acquisition of treasury stock) increased significantly in the current year compared to the prior year. While this is not unusual, it is worth confirming the purpose of the buyback and its alignment with shareholder interests. \n\nOverall, these points do not conclusively indicate fraud but highlight areas that may require further clarification or investigation. The report has been verified by a certified public accountant, and the numerical values are consistent, which reduces the likelihood of fraudulent activities."}

However, there are several logical and operational red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Significant Deterioration in Financial Performance**: The company has experienced a sharp decline in key financial metrics, such as operating profit (営業利益), ordinary profit (経常利益), and net income attributable to parent company shareholders (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益). For example, the net income dropped from a profit of 80.87 million yen in the prior year to a loss of 459.09 million yen in the current year. While this could be due to legitimate operational challenges, the magnitude of the decline warrants further scrutiny.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Asset Composition**: The balance sheet shows a significant increase in 'Investment Securities' (投資有価証券) from 4.34 million yen to 199.64 million yen and 'Other Investments and Other Assets' (その他、投資その他の資産) from 85.55 million yen to 268.13 million yen. At the same time, tangible fixed assets (有形固定資産) have decreased dramatically. This shift in asset composition could indicate an attempt to manipulate the balance sheet or hide losses.\n\n3. **Large Increase in Non-Current Liabilities**: Non-current liabilities (非流動負債) have increased significantly from 86.09 million yen to 325.44 million yen, primarily due to the introduction of a new 'Provision for Directors' Retirement Benefits' (役員退職慰労引当金) of 234.11 million yen. The timing and magnitude of this provision are unusual and could be an attempt to obscure financial performance.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: While operating cash flow (営業キャッシュフロー) has improved, the company has reported a significant outflow in investing activities (投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー), primarily due to the acquisition of investment securities. This could indicate a potential misallocation of resources or an attempt to inflate asset values.\n\n5. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The income statement shows a large 'Gain on Sale of Fixed Assets' (固定資産売却益) of 27.03 million yen and a 'Provision for Doubtful Accounts for Affiliates' (関係会社貸倒引当金繰入額) of 128.80 million yen. These items are non-recurring and could be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n6. **Employee Count Trends**: The number of regular employees has decreased from 69 to 64, while the average number of temporary employees has increased from 542 to 557. This shift could indicate cost-cutting measures or operational inefficiencies, but it also raises questions about the sustainability of the workforce structure.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation.

However, there are several logical and operational red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Declining Profitability**: The company has shown a significant decline in profitability over the years. The '経常利益' (ordinary profit) dropped from 166,492,000 yen in the prior year to 30,166,000 yen in the current year, and the '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders) turned negative in the current year (-5,939,000 yen). This is concerning, especially given the increase in sales ('売上高') from the prior year. A decline in profitability despite higher sales could indicate inefficiencies or mismanagement.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) has decreased significantly from 239,912,000 yen in the prior year to 120,020,000 yen in the current year. Additionally, the '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a large outflow of -164,273,000 yen, which is much higher than the prior year's outflow of -23,571,000 yen. This could indicate aggressive or poorly planned investments. Furthermore, the '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) shows a significant reduction in outflows, which might suggest a shift in financial strategy.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Allowances**: The '貸倒引当金の増減額' (provision for doubtful accounts) shows a significant decrease of -134,392,000 yen in the current year compared to an increase of 10,502,000 yen in the prior year. This could indicate an overly optimistic assessment of receivables, potentially to inflate profits.\n\n4. **Negative Trends in Equity**: The '純資産額' (net assets) has decreased from 590,073,000 yen in the prior year to 555,916,000 yen in the current year. This decline in equity, coupled with the negative net income, raises concerns about the company's financial health.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Employee Trends**: The '従業員数' (number of employees) has decreased steadily over the years, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) has fluctuated. This could indicate potential labor cost management issues or operational inefficiencies.\n\n6. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company shows a significant inflow from long-term borrowings ('長期借入れによる収入') of 500,000,000 yen in the current year, which was absent in the prior year. This sudden increase in borrowing could indicate liquidity issues or an attempt to cover operational shortfalls.\n\n7. **Negative '自己資本利益率' (ROE)**: The return on equity has turned negative (-0.010) in the current year, which is a significant deterioration from the prior year's positive ROE (0.140). This indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns for its shareholders.\n\n8. **Unusual Asset Movements**: The '建物及び構築物（純額）' (net amount of buildings and structures) has increased significantly from 253,914,000 yen in the prior year to 364,739,000 yen in the current year. This large increase in fixed assets, despite declining profitability, could indicate potential overstatement of assets or aggressive capital expenditure.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise significant concerns about the company's financial health, management practices, and potential misrepresentation of financial data."}

While this could be due to the nature of the business, it is worth investigating the reasons behind such volatility.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Temporary Employment**: The average number of temporary employees has dropped significantly from 188 in the Prior1Year to just 25 in the CurrentYear. This sharp decline is unusual and could indicate potential misreporting or a significant change in business operations that is not explained in the report.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Reporting of '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益'**: This metric is consistently reported as '－' (missing) across all years. While this could be due to the company not having any dilutive securities, it is unusual for a publicly listed company to not report this metric at all. This could indicate a lack of transparency.\n\n4. **Sharp Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents have increased significantly from Prior1Year to CurrentYear (from 15.8 billion yen to 26.1 billion yen). While this is not inherently fraudulent, the source of this increase should be scrutinized, especially given the relatively modest net income and cash flow from operations.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in '貸倒引当金' (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts)**: The allowance for doubtful accounts has increased significantly from -170 million yen in Prior1Year to -263 million yen in CurrentYear. This could indicate a potential issue with the quality of receivables or aggressive provisioning.\n\n6. **Decline in '退職給付に係る負債' (Retirement Benefit Obligations)**: The retirement benefit obligations have decreased significantly from 692 million yen in Prior1Year to 299 million yen in CurrentYear.

This is a significant change that is not fully explained by the other financial data, such as revenue or net income, which have not experienced such drastic changes. \n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Accounts Payable and Receivable**: The report shows a large decrease in accounts payable (仕入債務) of 7.03 billion yen and a large increase in accounts receivable (売上債権) of 2.91 billion yen. These changes could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or issues with supplier payments.\n\n3. **Discrepancies in Temporary Employee Numbers**: The average temporary employee count (平均臨時雇用人員) has fluctuated significantly over the years, from 247 three years ago to just 30 in the current year. Such large swings in temporary staffing levels are unusual and could indicate misreporting or an attempt to manipulate labor cost reporting.\n\n4. **Unexplained Decline in Comprehensive Income**: Comprehensive income (包括利益) has dropped significantly from 6.55 billion yen in the prior year to 2.08 billion yen in the current year, despite a relatively stable net income. This discrepancy is not clearly explained in the report and warrants further investigation.\n\n5. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The report includes a significant special loss (特別損失) of 793 million yen related to investment securities valuation, which is a new item not present in the prior year. Additionally, there is a special gain (特別利益) of 153 million yen from the sale of investment securities. These items could indicate attempts to manage earnings.\n\n6. **Negative Translation Adjustments**: The cash and cash equivalents translation adjustment (現金及び現金同等物に係る換算差額) has shifted from a positive 1.45 billion yen in the prior year to a negative 387 million yen in the current year. This could indicate currency-related issues or inconsistencies in reporting foreign operations.\n\n7. **Unusual Borrowing Activity**: The short-term borrowing (短期借入金) has increased significantly by 5.62 billion yen, and there is no corresponding increase in long-term borrowing.

This could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or changes in working capital management.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Trends in '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio)**: The equity ratio decreased from 0.714 in the prior year to 0.689 in the current year, despite an increase in '純資産額' (Net Assets). This inconsistency could be due to an increase in liabilities, which should be examined further.\n\n3. **Negative '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities)**: While negative cash flows from investing activities are common, the significant reduction in outflows from -3,687 million yen in the prior year to -2,356 million yen in the current year, coupled with a decrease in '投資有価証券の取得による支出' (Expenditure on Investment Securities), could indicate a slowdown in capital investment or asset sales. This should be cross-verified with the company's strategic plans.\n\n4. **'潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share)**: The absence of data ('－') for all years raises questions about whether the company has potential dilutive securities or if this metric is being intentionally omitted.\n\n5. **'特別利益合計' (Extraordinary Income) and '特別損失合計' (Extraordinary Loss)**: The extraordinary income dropped significantly from 242 million yen in the prior year to 39 million yen in the current year, while extraordinary losses also decreased from 1,293 million yen to 287 million yen. These changes should be examined to ensure they are not being used to manipulate net income.\n\n6. **'現金及び現金同等物' (Cash and Cash Equivalents)**: The significant increase in cash and cash equivalents from 7,576 million yen to 13,181 million yen, despite negative cash flows from investing and financing activities, should be reconciled with the cash flow statement to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. **'その他' (Other) Line Items**: The use of '－' or vague descriptions like 'その他' (Other) in several places, such as '営業外収益' (Non-Operating Income) and 'その他、投資その他の資産' (Other Investments and Assets), could indicate a lack of transparency.\n\nWhile these points do not conclusively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further scrutiny to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements."}

While this could be due to business expansion, such rapid growth should be supported by clear evidence of increased operations or new business lines. Without additional context, this could be a red flag for potential overstatement of operations.\n\n2. **Significant Increase in Treasury Stock (自己株式)**: The company has significantly increased its treasury stock from -137,993,000 to -343,305,000. While this could be part of a legitimate share buyback program, it is worth investigating whether this aligns with the company's stated strategy and whether it is being used to manipulate earnings per share (EPS).\n\n3. **Unusual Increase in Intangible Fixed Assets (無形固定資産)**: Intangible fixed assets have increased dramatically from 47,942,000 to 250,457,000. This is a significant jump and should be supported by clear disclosures about the nature of these assets (e.g., patents, software, goodwill). If not adequately explained, this could be a sign of potential overstatement of assets.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Exchange Translation Adjustments (為替換算調整勘定)**: The exchange translation adjustments have increased from -4,877,000 to -8,409,000. While this is not a large amount, it is worth verifying whether this aligns with the company's foreign operations and currency exposure.\n\n5. **Increase in Non-Controlling Interests (非支配株主持分)**: Non-controlling interests have appeared in the current year at 61,726,000, whereas they were absent in the prior year. This could indicate a new subsidiary or joint venture. It is important to verify the legitimacy and financial impact of this new entity.\n\n6. **Cash Flow from Financing Activities (財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー)**: The cash flow from financing activities has become more negative, primarily due to the acquisition of treasury stock and increased dividend payments. While this could be part of a shareholder return strategy, it is worth ensuring that the company is not over-leveraging or depleting cash reserves unsustainably.\n\nOverall, while the financial data appears consistent from a calculation perspective, the above points suggest areas that require further scrutiny.

This could be due to changes in ownership structure or consolidation adjustments, but it warrants further clarification to ensure there is no manipulation of ownership or profit allocation.\n\n3. **Unusual Increase in Special Losses (特別損失合計)**: The special losses increased significantly from 6,794,000 in the Prior Year to 25,304,000 in the Current Year. While this could be legitimate, the nature of these losses should be scrutinized to ensure they are not being used to manipulate taxable income or hide operational inefficiencies.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Comprehensive Income (包括利益)**: The comprehensive income for the Current Year (932,358,000) is lower than the net income attributable to parent company shareholders (980,010,000). This discrepancy could be due to foreign exchange adjustments or other comprehensive income items, but it should be clarified to ensure there is no misrepresentation.\n\n5. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: While the operating cash flow has increased consistently, the investment cash flow remains negative, and the financing cash flow shows a significant reduction in outflows. This could indicate a shift in financial strategy, but it should be verified to ensure there is no misrepresentation of cash flow activities.\n\n6. **Reduction in Intangible Fixed Assets (無形固定資産)**: The intangible fixed assets decreased significantly from 250,457,000 in the Prior Year to 186,415,000 in the Current Year.

This is primarily driven by a large '固定資産売却益' (gain on sale of fixed assets) of 396,166,000 yen. Such a large gain from asset sales could be a one-time event and may have been used to inflate profits artificially. \n\n2. **Significant Decrease in '短期借入金' (Short-term Borrowings):** The '短期借入金' (short-term borrowings) dropped drastically from 2,828,664,000 yen in the prior year to 642,500,000 yen in the current year. While this could indicate improved liquidity, it is worth investigating whether this reduction was achieved through legitimate means or if liabilities were shifted off the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Large Increase in '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Operating Cash Flow):** The operating cash flow increased significantly from 1,946,918,000 yen in the prior year to 3,196,347,000 yen in the current year. This increase is not fully explained by the changes in net income or other operating activities. It is important to verify whether this increase is sustainable or if it was achieved through aggressive working capital management or other non-recurring factors.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Investing Cash Flow):** The investing cash flow turned positive in the current year (265,401,000 yen) after being negative in the prior year (-512,662,000 yen). This is primarily due to a large inflow from the sale of fixed assets (743,785,000 yen). Such a shift could indicate asset liquidation to improve cash flow, which may not be sustainable.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Trends in '従業員数' (Number of Employees):** The number of employees decreased from 569 in the prior year to 519 in the current year, despite an increase in profitability and operating cash flow. This inconsistency could indicate cost-cutting measures that may not align with the company's reported growth.\n\n6. **Unusual Increase in '繰延税金資産' (Deferred Tax Assets):** The '繰延税金資産' (deferred tax assets) increased significantly from 1,906,000 yen in the prior year to 90,127,000 yen in the current year.

This is an unusually large swing and is not fully explained by corresponding changes in net income or other operational metrics. Secondly, the company's short-term borrowings (短期借入金) decreased drastically from 2,658,000,000 to 615,000,000, which is a significant reduction in liabilities. However, this is not matched by a proportional increase in other liabilities or equity, raising questions about how this was achieved. Thirdly, the company's investment in securities (投資有価証券) dropped sharply from 858,198,000 to 90,550,000, which is a significant change that is not explained in the report. Fourthly, the company's financial cash flow (財務キャッシュフロー) shifted from a large positive value (1,223,882,000) in the prior year to a large negative value (-1,788,777,000) in the current year, which is inconsistent with the company's overall financial position and raises questions about the source and use of funds.

This is concerning because the company is reporting a substantial increase in net income (当期純利益) and operating profit (営業利益), which is inconsistent with the cash flow trends. Secondly, the company's short-term borrowings (短期借入金) have increased significantly, from 1,630,000,000 in the prior year to 2,658,000,000 in the current year, which could indicate reliance on debt to sustain operations.

Fourthly, the company's self-reported equity ratio (自己資本比率) remains very low (0.115), indicating high leverage and financial risk. Lastly, there are inconsistencies in the reporting of certain items, such as the absence of bonus provisions (賞与引当金) and retirement benefit liabilities (退職給付に係る負債) in the current year, which were present in the prior year. These omissions could be an attempt to manipulate liabilities and improve the financial position artificially. While these issues do not definitively prove fraud, they raise significant concerns that should be investigated further."}

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow (営業キャッシュフロー) shows significant volatility, with a massive outflow of -9.27 billion yen in the prior year, followed by a much smaller outflow of -11.69 million yen in the current year. This drastic improvement in operating cash flow is not fully explained by the financial statements and could indicate potential manipulation.\n\n2. **Tax Payments**: The corporate tax payments (法人税等の支払額) dropped significantly from -426.4 million yen in the prior year to -82.82 million yen in the current year, despite an increase in pre-tax profit (税引前利益). This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of tax-related entries or potential tax avoidance strategies.\n\n3. **Debt Management**: The company has significantly reduced its long-term borrowings (長期借入金) from 5.03 billion yen in the prior year to 2.90 billion yen in the current year, while short-term borrowings (短期借入金) increased. This shift in debt structure could be a legitimate financial strategy, but it may also be an attempt to obscure financial risks.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The value of tangible fixed assets (有形固定資産) has increased significantly, from 299.6 million yen in the prior year to 515.8 million yen in the current year. This increase is not fully explained by the financial statements, as there is no corresponding large investment or acquisition disclosed in the cash flow statement.\n\n5. **Volatility in Inventory and Payables**: The inventory changes (棚卸資産の増減額) show a significant reduction in the current year compared to the prior year, which could indicate aggressive inventory management or potential misstatement. Similarly, the changes in accounts payable (仕入債務の増減額) show a notable decrease, which could be an attempt to manage liabilities artificially.\n\n6. **Self-Contradictory Entries**: The report contains some minor inconsistencies, such as the absence of certain entries (e.g., '－' for fixed asset sales) and mismatches in cash flow components. While these may be due to reporting errors, they could also indicate intentional obfuscation.\n\n7. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents (現金及び現金同等物) have decreased consistently over the years, which could indicate liquidity issues. However, the company has managed to maintain profitability, which seems contradictory.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further scrutiny. The drastic changes in cash flow, tax payments, and fixed assets, combined with inconsistencies in reporting, suggest a moderate probability of financial misrepresentation."}

This could indicate potential misreporting or manipulation of employee data. Secondly, the company's total assets more than doubled (from 64.5 billion yen to 143.7 billion yen) in one year, which is an extraordinary growth rate that warrants further scrutiny. This is accompanied by a significant increase in liabilities (from 38.4 billion yen to 106.3 billion yen), suggesting aggressive financing or potential over-leveraging. Thirdly, the intangible fixed assets increased dramatically (from 3.6 billion yen to 43.5 billion yen), which is disproportionate and could indicate potential overstatement of intangible assets. Lastly, the self-capital ratio dropped significantly (from 38.1% to 20.2%), which is a concerning trend and could indicate financial instability or aggressive accounting practices.

Firstly, there is a complete lack of historical data for all prior years across all financial metrics, which is highly unusual for a company filing a securities report. This absence of historical data makes it difficult to assess trends or validate the reported figures for the current year. Secondly, the company reports a significant net loss (当期純利益又は当期純損失: -321,083,000) despite a substantial revenue figure (売上高: 8,155,718,000), which raises questions about the efficiency of operations or potential mismanagement. Thirdly, the cash flow statement shows negative cash flows from both operating and investing activities, with only a small positive cash flow from financing activities, which could indicate liquidity issues. Additionally, the reported tax expense (法人所得税費用: 187,769,000) appears disproportionately high relative to the pre-tax loss (税引前利益: -133,313,000), which is illogical and suggests potential errors or manipulation. Lastly, the report has been verified by a certified public accountant, but the lack of historical data and logical inconsistencies in the figures raise concerns about the reliability of the verification process.

However, the '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) has increased during the same period (from 4,454 million yen to 5,191 million yen). This discrepancy between declining profitability and increasing cash flow could indicate potential earnings management or misclassification of cash flows.\n\n2. **Unusual Changes in Liabilities**: The '流動負債' (Current Liabilities) has increased dramatically from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear' (from 9,566 million yen to 16,913 million yen). This significant increase in short-term liabilities without a corresponding increase in assets or revenue could indicate liquidity issues or aggressive financing practices.\n\n3. **Non-Disclosure of Non-Controlling Interests**: The '非支配株主持分' (Non-Controlling Interests) is reported as '－' (missing) for the 'CurrentYear', despite being reported as 842 million yen in 'Prior1Year'. This sudden disappearance of non-controlling interests without explanation is unusual and could indicate potential manipulation or misreporting.\n\n4. **Decline in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has decreased significantly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear' (from 2,256 to 1,857). While this could be due to restructuring or cost-cutting measures, it is not accompanied by a proportional decrease in '販売費及び一般管理費' (Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses), which only slightly decreased. This inconsistency could suggest misreporting of employee-related expenses.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Equity Accounts**: The '資本剰余金' (Capital Surplus) has dropped significantly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear' (from 374 million yen to 1 million yen). Such a drastic reduction in capital surplus without a clear explanation is unusual and could indicate potential equity mismanagement or reclassification.\n\n6. **Discrepancy in Comprehensive Income**: The '当期包括利益: 親会社の所有者に帰属（IFRS）' (Comprehensive Income Attributable to Parent Company Owners) has dropped significantly from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear' (from 2,715 million yen to 1,358 million yen). This sharp decline, coupled with the other inconsistencies, raises questions about the company's financial health and reporting practices.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, these logical inconsistencies and unusual trends suggest the possibility of fraudulent activities or at least aggressive accounting practices. Further investigation and clarification from the company are recommended."}

Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The cash flow from operating activities (営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) shows a significant fluctuation, moving from a large positive value in the prior year (¥2,202,347,000) to a much smaller positive value in the current year (¥314,580,000). This is inconsistent with the steady increase in revenue and profits, which would typically result in a more stable or increasing operating cash flow.\n\n2. **Investment Cash Flow Spike**: The cash flow from investing activities (投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) shows a significant outflow in the current year (¥-1,361,652,000), which is much larger than in previous years. This could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or asset purchases, but the corresponding increase in fixed assets (e.g., 有形固定資産) seems disproportionately high, raising questions about the legitimacy of these transactions.\n\n3. **Debt and Financing Activities**: The cash flow from financing activities (財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー) shows a large positive value in the current year (¥952,153,000) after a significant negative value in the prior year (¥-1,788,777,000). This suggests heavy reliance on external financing, which could be a sign of liquidity issues or an attempt to mask operational cash flow problems.\n\n4. **Inventory and Accounts Receivable**: The inventory (棚卸資産) has increased significantly, as seen in the cash flow statement (¥-531,563,000), which could indicate overproduction or potential manipulation to inflate assets. Similarly, accounts receivable (売掛金) has increased, which could be a sign of revenue recognition issues or delayed collections.\n\n5. **Profitability Metrics**: The net profit attributable to parent company shareholders (親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益) has decreased from the prior year despite an increase in revenue. This could be due to higher costs or expenses, but the report does not provide a clear explanation for this discrepancy.\n\n6. **Unusual Asset Movements**: The land (土地) value has increased significantly from ¥135,383,000 to ¥692,989,000, which is unusual unless there was a major acquisition. However, this is not clearly explained in the report, raising questions about the legitimacy of this increase.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: There are several instances of missing or incomplete data (e.g., 潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益 for Prior3Year, その他 in the current year for 営業外収益). While this could be due to parsing errors, it makes it difficult to fully assess the report's accuracy and transparency.\n\n8. **Self-Contradictory Metrics**: The self-reported financial ratios, such as the equity ratio (自己資本比率), show inconsistent trends. For example, the ratio decreased from 0.176 in the prior year to 0.150 in the current year, despite an increase in net assets (純資産額). This inconsistency could indicate errors or intentional manipulation.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, the logical inconsistencies, unusual trends, and lack of transparency in certain areas raise concerns about potential fraudulent activities."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation: \n\n1. **Unusual Fluctuations in Key Metrics**: The company's financial performance shows significant volatility. For example, the '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) swings from a large loss of -999,234,000 yen in the prior year to a profit of 925,178,000 yen in the current year. Such a drastic turnaround in a single year is unusual and could indicate aggressive accounting practices or one-time adjustments.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Trends in Cash Flows**: The cash flow from operating activities ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has fluctuated significantly over the years, from a large negative value in Prior3Year (-4,871,556,000 yen) to a positive value in the current year (550,606,000 yen). This inconsistency, combined with the company's history of losses, raises questions about the sustainability of its operations.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: The '未収入金' (Accounts Receivable) has more than doubled from 2,174,194,000 yen in the prior year to 5,019,660,000 yen in the current year. This could indicate potential revenue recognition issues, where revenue is being recorded prematurely or without proper basis.\n\n4. **High Leverage and Low Equity**: The company's '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio) remains very low at 0.133 in the current year, indicating high reliance on debt. Additionally, the '利益剰余金' (Retained Earnings) remains negative, suggesting accumulated losses over time. This financial structure could pressure management to manipulate financial results to appear more favorable.\n\n5. **Unusual Items in Financial Statements**: The '特別利益合計' (Extraordinary Income) and '特別損失合計' (Extraordinary Loss) show significant changes year-over-year. For example, extraordinary income increased from 124,667,000 yen in the prior year to 246,092,000 yen in the current year, while extraordinary losses dropped dramatically from 1,127,499,000 yen to 62,334,000 yen. These items could be used to manipulate net income.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: Several fields, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted EPS) and '株価収益率' (PER), are missing or marked as '－' in prior years. While this could be due to legitimate reasons, it reduces transparency and makes it harder to assess the company's performance.\n\n7. **Rapid Changes in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') and temporary staff ('平均臨時雇用人員') has fluctuated significantly over the years. For example, temporary staff increased from 58 in the prior year to 84 in the current year. Such changes could indicate operational instability or attempts to manipulate labor costs.\n\nWhile these red flags do not conclusively prove fraud, they suggest the need for further investigation into the company's accounting practices, revenue recognition policies, and financial disclosures."}

This sharp decline in net income is not adequately explained by the report, especially since '売上総利益' (Gross Profit) and '営業利益' (Operating Profit) also show a decline but not to the same extent. \n\n2. **Discrepancy in Borrowing and Debt Management**: The '短期借入金' (Short-term Borrowings) increased significantly from 1,642,912,000 yen to 2,627,160,000 yen, and '１年内返済予定の長期借入金' (Current Portion of Long-term Debt) jumped from 512,980,000 yen to 3,998,600,000 yen. However, '長期借入金' (Long-term Borrowings) decreased drastically from 4,828,100,000 yen to 953,000,000 yen. This sudden shift in debt structure is unusual and could indicate an attempt to manipulate liabilities or cash flow. \n\n3. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) remains relatively strong, but '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) shows a significant outflow of -2,395,745,000 yen, which is a marked improvement from the prior year's -5,965,713,000 yen. However, the '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Financing Activities) dropped sharply from 2,829,467,000 yen to 290,310,000 yen. This inconsistency in cash flow patterns raises questions about the company's financial management and reporting. \n\n4. **Unusual Changes in '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio)**: The equity ratio has remained relatively stable, but the '自己資本利益率' (Return on Equity) dropped significantly from 0.300 in the prior year to 0.016 in the current year. This is inconsistent with the company's revenue growth and suggests potential issues with profitability or asset utilization. \n\n5. **Potential Data Errors or Omissions**: There are missing or inconsistent data points, such as '売掛金' (Accounts Receivable) for the current year being marked as '－'. While this could be a parsing error, it raises concerns about the completeness and accuracy of the report. \n\n6. **Sharp Decline in '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'**: The net income attributable to parent company shareholders dropped significantly, while '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income) remains relatively high. This discrepancy could indicate the use of accounting adjustments or other methods to inflate comprehensive income while suppressing net income. \n\n7. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (Income Tax Adjustments) shows a significant reversal from -797,976,000 yen in the prior year to -71,214,000 yen in the current year. This large adjustment could indicate aggressive tax planning or manipulation. \n\n8. **Significant Changes in '評価・換算差額等' (Valuation and Translation Adjustments)**: The valuation and translation adjustments increased significantly from 307,284,000 yen to 1,271,192,000 yen. This could indicate reliance on unrealized gains or foreign exchange adjustments to boost equity. \n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent from a calculation perspective, the logical inconsistencies, unusual fluctuations, and unexplained changes in key metrics suggest a moderate probability of fraudulent activities."}

This could indicate issues with cost management or revenue recognition practices. Additionally, the '売上債権の増減額' (accounts receivable changes) shows a dramatic increase in the current year, suggesting potential aggressive revenue recognition or delayed collections. The '賞与引当金の増減額' (bonus reserve changes) shows a significant decrease, which could indicate under-provisioning for employee bonuses. Furthermore, the '投資有価証券' (investment securities) dropped drastically from 540,156,000 to 13,967,000, which is unusual and could indicate asset reclassification or liquidation.

The company's '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) has been declining for the past two years, despite an increase in '売上高' (Revenue) and '営業利益' (Operating Profit). This could be due to higher tax expenses or other non-operating factors, but it warrants further investigation.\n2. The '減価償却費及び償却費' (Depreciation and Amortization) has decreased significantly from the prior year, which could be due to asset disposals or changes in accounting estimates. This should be cross-verified with the fixed asset details.\n3. The '現金及び現金同等物の増減額' (Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents) shows a significant negative change in the prior year, followed by a smaller negative change in the current year. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it suggests potential liquidity concerns or significant cash outflows that should be explained.\n4. The '特別利益合計' (Total Extraordinary Income) is zero in the current year, whereas it was positive in the prior year. This could indicate a one-time gain in the prior year that is absent this year, but the absence of extraordinary income in the current year should be clarified.\n5.

This could be due to amortization or impairment, but the report does not provide sufficient details to confirm this. The presence of a '減損損失' (impairment loss) in the current year of 41,346,000 yen might explain part of this, but the lack of detailed disclosure is a concern.\n\n3. **Negative Operating Cash Flow Trend**: While the company has positive operating cash flow, it has decreased from 508,234,000 yen in the prior year to 404,162,000 yen in the current year. This decline, coupled with an increase in '法人税等の支払額' (corporate tax payments) from 180,185,000 yen to 353,960,000 yen, could indicate cash flow management issues.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Employee Trends**: The '従業員数' (number of employees) increased from 133 to 167, but the '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) decreased from 112 to 87. This could be a normal adjustment, but the report does not explain the rationale behind this shift, which could be a red flag for labor cost manipulation.\n\n5. **Sudden Appearance of '退職給付に係る負債' (retirement benefit liabilities)**: This liability appears for the first time in the current year at 34,695,000 yen. The report does not explain why this liability was not present in prior years, which could indicate a change in accounting policy or an attempt to defer recognition of liabilities in previous periods.\n\n6. **Unusual '負ののれん発生益' (negative goodwill gain)**: The report shows a negative goodwill gain of 13,669,000 yen in the current year, which was not present in the prior year.

This disconnect between revenue growth and profitability is unusual and could indicate issues with revenue recognition or cost management.\n\n2. **Negative Equity in Prior Years**: The company reported negative equity ('純資産額') in 'Prior4Year' and 'Prior3Year', which is highly unusual for a company that later reports significant revenue growth. This raises questions about the accuracy of past financial statements or the sustainability of the current financial position.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a significant increase in the 'CurrentYear', which is inconsistent with the company's declining profitability. Additionally, the investment cash flow ('投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a large outflow in the 'CurrentYear', which could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or potential misclassification of expenses.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Working Capital**: The balance sheet ('bs') shows significant changes in accounts such as '売掛金' (accounts receivable), '仕入債務' (accounts payable), and '棚卸資産' (inventory). For example, accounts receivable decreased significantly, while accounts payable also decreased, which could indicate aggressive collection practices or payment delays to suppliers.\n\n5. **Employee Count Volatility**: The number of employees ('従業員数') and temporary staff ('平均臨時雇用人員') fluctuates significantly over the years, which is unusual for a company with stable or growing revenue. This could indicate issues with workforce management or potential misreporting.\n\n6. **Negative Metrics**: Key financial ratios such as '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) and '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio) are negative or highly volatile, which is unusual and could indicate financial instability or misreporting.\n\n7. **Unusual Transactions**: The cash flow statement ('cf') shows unusual transactions, such as a significant increase in '前受金' (advances received) in the 'CurrentYear', which could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices.\n\n8. **Missing Data**: Several fields, such as '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted earnings per share), are missing ('－') for multiple years, which could indicate a lack of transparency or incomplete reporting.\n\nWhile these observations do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight significant inconsistencies and unusual patterns that warrant further investigation."}

Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Dramatic Decline in Key Metrics**: The company's net assets ('純資産額') have plummeted from 327 billion yen in the prior year to just 82 billion yen in the current year, a significant drop. Similarly, the equity ratio ('自己資本比率') has fallen from 35.5% to 13.1%, indicating a sharp deterioration in financial stability.\n\n2. **Negative Profitability Trends**: The company has reported consistent and increasing losses over the years, with the current year's net loss ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') reaching a staggering -247 billion yen. This is coupled with a negative operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') of -754 million yen, a sharp reversal from the prior year's positive cash flow of 112 billion yen.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: There are significant and unexplained changes in certain accounts. For example, accounts receivable ('売掛金') dropped from 128.6 billion yen to 82.8 billion yen, and advances received ('前受金') decreased by 51.1 billion yen. These changes could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or issues with customer collections.\n\n4. **Inventory and Payables Fluctuations**: Inventory levels ('棚卸資産') have decreased significantly, while accounts payable ('仕入債務') have dropped by 82.3 billion yen. These could indicate potential manipulation of working capital to improve cash flow or financial ratios artificially.\n\n5. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company has significantly increased its short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') by 73.3 billion yen, which could be a sign of liquidity issues. Additionally, there is a lack of long-term borrowing or bond issuance in the current year, which may indicate limited access to long-term financing.\n\n6. **Discrepancies in Depreciation and Impairment**: Despite reporting significant losses, the company has not recorded any impairment losses ('減損損失') in the current year, which is unusual given the financial distress. This could indicate an attempt to avoid further deterioration of the financial statements.\n\n7. **Employee Reductions**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has decreased significantly from 13,173 to 11,542, and temporary staff ('平均臨時雇用人員') have also been reduced. While this could be a cost-cutting measure, it may also indicate operational challenges.\n\n8. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The company has reported a relatively low tax expense ('法人所得税費用') despite significant losses, which could indicate aggressive tax planning or potential misstatements.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the logical inconsistencies, unusual fluctuations, and significant financial deterioration raise concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements.

Firstly, the company's financial performance shows significant volatility, such as a sharp decline in '売上高' (revenue) from 'Prior1Year' to 'CurrentYear' despite an increase in '総資産額' (total assets). This inconsistency could suggest revenue manipulation or misclassification of assets. Secondly, the '純資産額' (net assets) has been declining consistently, yet the company has managed to increase its '現金及び現金同等物' (cash and cash equivalents) significantly in the 'CurrentYear'. This could indicate potential cash flow manipulation or unreported liabilities. Thirdly, the '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows large outflows, but there is no clear corresponding increase in productive assets, as '有形固定資産' (tangible fixed assets) has only marginally increased. Fourthly, the '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) shows a significant inflow in the 'CurrentYear', primarily due to '社債の発行による収入' (proceeds from bond issuance) and '長期借入れによる収入' (proceeds from long-term borrowings). However, the company's declining profitability and negative '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (net income attributable to parent company shareholders) raise concerns about its ability to service this debt. Lastly, the '従業員数' (number of employees) has decreased significantly, which could indicate operational downsizing, yet the company reports an increase in '売掛金' (accounts receivable) and '未収入金' (uncollected revenue).

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Deteriorating Financial Health**: The company's financial health has been deteriorating significantly over the years. For example, the '純資産額' (Net Assets) has dropped from 402.6 billion yen four years ago to just 7 billion yen in the current year. Similarly, the '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio) has plummeted from 48.2% to 0.9%, indicating that the company is heavily reliant on debt and has almost no equity cushion left.\n\n2. **Negative and Worsening Profitability**: The company has been consistently reporting negative '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit) and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) for the past five years. While losses are not inherently fraudulent, the scale and persistence of these losses raise concerns about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n3. **Unusual Trends in Cash Flows**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) turned negative in the prior year and remains negative in the current year, despite a significant reduction in '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities). This suggests that the company is struggling to generate cash from its core operations, which is a critical red flag.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Asset and Liability Movements**: The '流動資産' (Current Assets) increased slightly, but '流動負債' (Current Liabilities) increased significantly, leading to a worsening liquidity position. Additionally, the '買掛金' (Accounts Payable) and '短期借入金' (Short-term Borrowings) have increased substantially, which could indicate that the company is delaying payments to suppliers or relying on short-term debt to finance operations.\n\n5. **Unusual Accounting Entries**: The report includes a significant '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) of 75.1 billion yen in the current year, which is a sharp increase from zero in the prior year. While impairment losses can be legitimate, the sudden and large amount warrants scrutiny, as it could be used to manipulate earnings.\n\n6. **Declining Workforce**: The number of employees has been steadily declining, from 16,984 four years ago to 10,085 in the current year. While this could be a cost-cutting measure, it also raises questions about the company's operational capacity and long-term viability.\n\n7. **Unusual Items in Equity**: The '自己株式' (Treasury Stock) shows a value of '-0' in the current year, which is unusual and could indicate a data entry or reporting error. Additionally, the 'その他有価証券評価差額金' (Valuation Difference on Available-for-sale Securities) shows a value of '-1 million yen,' which is inconsistent with prior years and could indicate an attempt to manipulate equity.\n\n8. **Auditor Verification**: While the report has been verified by a certified public accountant, this does not guarantee the absence of fraud. Auditors rely on the information provided by the company, and fraudulent activities can sometimes go undetected.\n\nGiven these observations, there are multiple red flags that suggest the possibility of fraudulent activities or at least significant financial mismanagement.

This could indicate aggressive expansion or potential misrepresentation of investment activities.\n\n2. **Decline in Operating Cash Flow Despite Revenue Growth**: Despite a significant increase in revenue (from 2.77 billion yen to 3.71 billion yen), the operating cash flow turned negative (from 16.75 million yen to -22.60 million yen). This is unusual and could indicate issues with cash collection, inflated revenue, or increased operating expenses that are not fully explained.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The value of intangible fixed assets increased significantly (from 27.18 million yen to 686.83 million yen), and tangible fixed assets also saw a large increase (from 11.22 million yen to 198.49 million yen). Such large changes in asset values should be supported by clear disclosures, which are not evident in the provided data.\n\n4. **Mismatch in Profitability Metrics**: The company's net income decreased (from 110.69 million yen to 53.79 million yen), but the tax expense remained relatively high (84.13 million yen). This could indicate potential issues with tax reporting or profit manipulation.\n\n5. **Rapid Increase in Debt and Liabilities**: The company significantly increased its short-term borrowings (from 200 million yen to 500 million yen) and issued new bonds (from 10 million yen to 237.30 million yen). While this could be part of a growth strategy, the lack of corresponding growth in operating cash flow raises concerns about the sustainability of this debt.\n\n6. **Employee Count and Revenue Discrepancy**: The number of employees increased dramatically (from 68 to 132), but the revenue per employee decreased. This could indicate inefficiencies or potential misrepresentation of employee data.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Equity Accounts**: The company's retained earnings increased modestly (from 313.36 million yen to 367.15 million yen), but this does not align well with the significant changes in other financial metrics, such as cash flow and liabilities.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that should be investigated further.

Such rapid growth is unusual and could indicate aggressive accounting practices or undisclosed risks.\n\n2. **Deteriorating Equity Ratio**: The equity ratio has declined sharply from 54% (Prior4Year) to 8.2% (CurrentYear). This indicates that the company is heavily reliant on debt financing, which could be a sign of financial distress or an attempt to inflate asset values.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Profit Metrics**: The '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) shows a significant drop in the CurrentYear (9.45 million yen) compared to Prior1Year (313.91 million yen). However, the IFRS-based net income for the same metric is reported as 331.18 million yen in the CurrentYear. This discrepancy between the two accounting standards is unusual and requires clarification.\n\n4. **Unusual Employee Growth**: The number of employees has grown from 17 (Prior4Year) to 363 (CurrentYear), which is an extraordinary increase. Such rapid expansion could indicate overstatement of operations or potential misrepresentation of employee data.\n\n5. **High Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: The P/E ratio has skyrocketed to 2606.7 in the CurrentYear, which is abnormally high and suggests that the stock price is not aligned with the company's earnings. This could indicate speculative trading or manipulation of stock prices.\n\n6. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The cash flow from financing activities shows large inflows in Prior1Year (2.73 billion yen) and CurrentYear (1.44 billion yen), which are inconsistent with the company's declining equity ratio and could indicate reliance on external funding to sustain operations.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: Several key metrics, such as '税引前利益(IFRS)' and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益 (IFRS)' for Prior2Year, are missing ('－'). While this could be a parsing error, it raises questions about the completeness and transparency of the report.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Profitability Trends**: The comprehensive income attributable to parent company owners (IFRS) shows significant fluctuations, with a sharp drop in Prior1Year (174.39 million yen) followed by a recovery in the CurrentYear (326.81 million yen).

The '自己株式の取得による支出' (Expenditure for Treasury Stock Acquisition) in the Current Year (-176,000) is a new entry compared to the Prior Year, where it was not reported.

The '投資有価証券売却益' (Gain on Sale of Investment Securities) is reported as 175,979,000 in the Prior Year but is absent in the Current Year.

This dramatic turnaround is unusual and should be scrutinized for potential manipulation. Secondly, the '減損損失' (Impairment loss) of 1,138,789,000 yen in the prior year is completely absent in the current year, which could indicate an attempt to 'clean up' the financials in the prior year to show better results in the current year. Thirdly, the '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating cash flow) has increased significantly from 81,955,000 yen in the prior year to 825,002,000 yen in the current year, which is inconsistent with the relatively modest increase in sales and could suggest aggressive revenue recognition or other manipulative practices.

This increase is partially explained by a large inflow from financing activities ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー'), which includes a substantial increase in long-term borrowing ('長期借入れによる収入'). However, the company's ability to generate such high cash flow from operations ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') in the CurrentYear (662.8 million yen) compared to Prior1Year (358.2 million yen) seems inconsistent with the relatively modest increase in revenue.

These changes are not fully explained by the company's operational activities and could indicate potential manipulation to improve cash flow or financial ratios.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Tax Adjustments**: The tax adjustments ('法人税等調整額') show a significant negative adjustment in both Prior1Year (-34.9 million yen) and CurrentYear (-18.9 million yen). While this is not inherently suspicious, the adjustments should be explained in detail, as they could be used to manipulate net income.\n\n5. **Rapid Increase in Equity**: The company's equity ('純資産') increased significantly from 380.1 million yen (Prior1Year) to 1.13 billion yen (CurrentYear). This increase is primarily driven by retained earnings ('利益剰余金'), which grew from 195.3 million yen (Prior1Year) to 746.7 million yen (CurrentYear). Such rapid growth in equity, especially retained earnings, should be supported by clear and detailed explanations.\n\n6. **Potential Issues with Depreciation and Impairment**: The company reported an impairment loss ('減損損失') of 12.3 million yen in the CurrentYear, which was not present in Prior1Year. Additionally, depreciation expenses ('減価償却費及び償却費') decreased slightly from 36.1 million yen (Prior1Year) to 32.6 million yen (CurrentYear), despite an increase in fixed assets. This could indicate underreporting of depreciation or selective impairment to manage earnings.\n\n7. **Lack of Detail on Extraordinary Items**: The report mentions a special loss ('特別損失合計') of 12.3 million yen in the CurrentYear, but no details are provided. Extraordinary items should be clearly explained to ensure transparency.\n\n8. **Omission of Diluted EPS in Prior Years**: The diluted EPS ('潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益') is only reported for the CurrentYear (76.71 yen) and is missing for Prior1Year and Prior2Year. This omission could indicate a lack of transparency or an attempt to obscure historical performance.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas that require further investigation and clarification. The rapid growth in key metrics, significant changes in cash flow and accounts, and lack of detailed explanations for certain items are potential red flags."}

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Significant Fluctuations in Key Metrics**: There are notable fluctuations in key financial metrics such as '経常利益' (Ordinary Profit), '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders), and '包括利益' (Comprehensive Income). For example, the '経常利益' dropped significantly from 1,400 million yen in the prior year to 776 million yen in the current year, while '売上高' (Revenue) increased. This inconsistency between revenue growth and profit decline could indicate issues with cost management or potential manipulation of expenses.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) shows a dramatic turnaround from a negative 484 million yen in the prior year to a positive 1,003 million yen in the current year. This sharp reversal, especially when paired with declining profits, could suggest aggressive accounting practices or one-time adjustments.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Fixed Assets**: The '無形固定資産' (Intangible Fixed Assets) increased significantly from 2,042 million yen to 3,653 million yen. This large increase in intangible assets could be a sign of overvaluation or improper capitalization of expenses.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Borrowing Patterns**: The '長期借入金' (Long-term Borrowings) more than doubled from 1,023 million yen to 2,104 million yen, and there was a significant inflow of 2,450 million yen from long-term borrowings in the cash flow statement. This sudden increase in debt, coupled with declining profits, could indicate liquidity issues or reliance on external financing to cover operational shortfalls.\n\n5. **Unusual Gains and Losses**: The '投資有価証券売却益' (Gain on Sale of Investment Securities) increased significantly from 84 million yen to 310 million yen, contributing to the '特別利益合計' (Total Extraordinary Income). This reliance on one-time gains to boost income could be a red flag for earnings management.\n\n6. **Decline in Key Ratios**: The '自己資本利益率' (Return on Equity) dropped significantly from 18.0% to 8.9%, and the '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio) also declined slightly. These trends indicate deteriorating financial performance and stability.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: The absence of data for '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average Temporary Employees) and other minor items could indicate incomplete disclosure, though this alone is not necessarily fraudulent.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above points suggest potential red flags that warrant further investigation.

Firstly, the company's net assets ('純資産額') have turned negative in the current year, which is a significant financial deterioration. Despite this, the company has managed to increase its cash and cash equivalents ('現金及び現金同等物') significantly, which is unusual given the negative net income and declining equity. This could suggest potential manipulation of cash flow reporting. Secondly, the company has reported a significant reduction in long-term borrowings ('長期借入金') and an increase in bonds payable ('社債'), which could indicate aggressive refinancing or potential misclassification of liabilities. Thirdly, the company's operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has turned positive in the current year after being negative in the prior year, despite continued operating losses ('営業利益'). This discrepancy between cash flow and profitability could suggest potential earnings management or timing differences in recognizing revenues and expenses. Lastly, the company's intangible fixed assets ('無形固定資産') have decreased significantly, which could indicate potential impairment or write-offs, but the details are not clear.

While this could be due to a one-time event, the report does not provide sufficient explanation for this anomaly.\n   - The '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) for the 'CurrentYear' is extremely high (196.63), which could indicate overvaluation or manipulation of earnings.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**:\n   - The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash flow from operating activities) has increased significantly in the 'CurrentYear' (1,351,742,000) compared to prior years. This is not proportionate to the decline in '経常利益' (Ordinary profit), which dropped from 445,904,000 in 'Prior1Year' to 275,573,000 in 'CurrentYear'. This mismatch could indicate potential earnings management.\n   - The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash flow from investing activities) shows a sharp increase in outflows in the 'CurrentYear' (-1,919,555,000), which is significantly higher than previous years. This could be legitimate, but the report does not provide details on the nature of these investments.\n\n3. **Significant Changes in Balance Sheet Items**:\n   - The '現金及び現金同等物' (Cash and cash equivalents) more than doubled from 'Prior1Year' (989,128,000) to 'CurrentYear' (2,288,014,000). This is unusual given the relatively modest increase in revenue and the decline in profits.\n   - The '投資有価証券' (Investment securities) increased dramatically from 540,000 in 'Prior1Year' to 664,923,000 in 'CurrentYear'. This sudden increase in investments could be a way to manipulate financial results.\n\n4. **Inconsistencies in Employee Data**:\n   - The '従業員数' (Number of employees) has remained relatively stable between 'Prior1Year' (219) and 'CurrentYear' (220), but the '平均臨時雇用人員' (Average temporary employees) dropped significantly from 42 in 'Prior1Year' to 34 in 'CurrentYear'. This inconsistency could indicate potential misreporting of labor costs or employee-related expenses.\n\n5. **Unexplained Items**:\n   - The 'リース資産' (Leased assets) appears for the first time in the 'CurrentYear' (86,968,000) without any prior mention. This sudden appearance of a new asset category could indicate an attempt to inflate assets.\n   - The '非支配株主持分' (Non-controlling interests) also appears for the first time in the 'CurrentYear' (45,758,000), which could indicate a change in ownership structure that is not explained in the report.\n\n6. **Potential Earnings Management**:\n   - The '減価償却費及び償却費' (Depreciation and amortization) increased significantly from 412,621,000 in 'Prior1Year' to 591,764,000 in 'CurrentYear'.

Such drastic swings in profitability could indicate aggressive accounting practices or one-time adjustments.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Employee Growth vs. Revenue Growth**: The number of employees has grown significantly from 70 in 'Prior4Year' to 219 in 'CurrentYear', which is a 213% increase. However, the revenue growth over the same period is approximately 134%. While this is not inherently fraudulent, the disproportionate growth in employees relative to revenue could indicate inefficiencies or misreporting.\n\n3. **Sharp Increase in '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Investing Activities)**: The cash outflow from investing activities has increased significantly in 'CurrentYear' (-1,256,563,000 yen) compared to 'Prior1Year' (-696,262,000 yen). This could be due to legitimate investments, but the lack of detailed explanation raises questions about the nature of these investments.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in '短期借入金' (Short-term Borrowings)**: The company reported no short-term borrowings in 'Prior1Year', but a significant increase to 280,000,000 yen in 'CurrentYear'. This sudden change in financing strategy should be explained in the report.\n\n5. **Decline in '自己資本比率' (Equity Ratio)**: The equity ratio has been declining steadily from 78.22% in 'Prior4Year' to 40.06% in 'CurrentYear'. This indicates increasing reliance on debt, which could be a sign of financial stress or aggressive expansion.\n\n6. **Inconsistencies in '非支配株主持分' (Non-controlling Interests)**: The '非支配株主持分' value is reported as 2,206,000 yen in 'Prior1Year' but is missing ('－') in 'CurrentYear'.

Such a drastic decline in revenue is highly unusual and warrants further investigation. \n\n2. **Profitability Issues**: The company has reported a significant loss in the current year ('経常利益' and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'), with a negative net income of -1.4 billion yen. This is a stark contrast to the prior year's positive figures. Additionally, the operating profit ('営業利益') has turned negative, indicating operational inefficiencies or challenges.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has worsened significantly, from -1.34 billion yen in the prior year to -2.99 billion yen in the current year. However, the financing cash flow ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') has increased dramatically to 3.88 billion yen, primarily due to a large increase in short-term borrowings ('短期借入金'). This reliance on debt to sustain operations is concerning and could indicate liquidity issues.\n\n4. **Employee Count**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has decreased from 376 to 289, and the average temporary staff ('平均臨時雇用人員') has dropped drastically from 117 to 19. Such a significant reduction in workforce could indicate operational downsizing or financial distress.\n\n5. **Equity Erosion**: The company's equity ('純資産額') has decreased significantly from 1.54 billion yen to 508 million yen, and the equity ratio ('自己資本比率') has dropped to 0.088, indicating a highly leveraged position. The retained earnings ('利益剰余金') have turned negative, further eroding shareholder value.\n\n6. **Unusual Financial Activities**: The company has reported a significant increase in '営業外収益' (non-operating income), primarily due to 'その他' (other income). This sudden spike in non-operating income could be an attempt to offset operational losses and should be scrutinized.\n\n7. **Inconsistencies in Borrowings**: The short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') have increased from 700 million yen to 3.7 billion yen, and long-term borrowings ('長期借入金') have appeared for the first time at 500 million yen.

While growth is not inherently suspicious, such a sharp increase warrants scrutiny, especially when compared to prior years' trends.\n\n2. **Self-Contradictory Financial Ratios**: The self-reported '自己資本比率' (equity ratio) decreased from 0.286 in the prior year to 0.203 in the current year, despite an increase in net assets ('純資産額') and a significant increase in cash and cash equivalents ('現金及び現金同等物').

Such a significant increase in equity within a single year is unusual and should be explained, such as through a major capital injection or issuance of new shares. However, no such explanation is provided in the report.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Profitability Ratios**: The '自己資本利益率' (return on equity) dropped from 0.134 to 0.049 despite a significant increase in net income ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'). This is counterintuitive and suggests that the increase in equity may not be proportionate to the company's actual profitability.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Anomalies**: The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) increased dramatically from 59,042,000 to 1,985,747,000. This is a massive jump and should be supported by clear details, such as large borrowings or equity financing. However, the report does not provide sufficient context for this increase.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Assets and Liabilities**: The '総資産額' (total assets) more than doubled from 1,402,353,000 to 3,627,748,000, and '負債' (liabilities) also increased significantly. While growth is not inherently suspicious, the scale of these changes within a single year is unusual and should be supported by clear operational or financial activities, which are not detailed in the report.\n\n5. **Significant Increase in '特別利益' and '特別損失'**: The '特別利益合計' (extraordinary income) and '特別損失合計' (extraordinary losses) both increased dramatically, from 69,255,000 and 69,142,000 to 822,899,000 and 820,585,000, respectively. Such large extraordinary items are unusual and should be explained in detail, as they can be used to manipulate net income.\n\n6. **Inconsistencies in Employee Numbers**: The '従業員数' (number of employees) increased from 275 to 386, while the '平均臨時雇用人員' (average temporary employees) increased from 1,557 to 1,895.

While growth is not inherently suspicious, the rapid turnaround from losses to substantial profits warrants scrutiny, especially in the absence of a clear explanation for such a dramatic improvement.\n\n2. **Discrepancies in Cash Flow Trends**: The '営業キャッシュフロー' (Operating Cash Flow) has decreased significantly from the prior year, despite an increase in '売上高' (Revenue) and '営業利益' (Operating Profit). This divergence between cash flow and profitability metrics could indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices or issues with receivables collection.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has increased dramatically over the years, from 571 in the Prior4Year to 1487 in the CurrentYear. While growth in headcount can be a sign of expansion, the scale of this increase seems disproportionate to the company's financial performance and may require further investigation.\n\n4. **High Leverage and Asset Growth**: The company's '負債' (Liabilities) and '総資産' (Total Assets) have grown significantly in the CurrentYear. The increase in liabilities, coupled with a relatively modest increase in equity, could indicate over-leveraging.

This could indicate a shift in employment practices or potential misreporting.\n\n6. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) shows a large inflow of 784,402,000 in the current year, with no corresponding outflow in the prior year. This could indicate new financing or debt issuance, but the lack of detailed explanation is concerning.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Reporting of Special Items**: The '特別利益合計' (total extraordinary income) and '特別損失合計' (total extraordinary losses) are reported in the prior year but are absent in the current year. This inconsistency could indicate an attempt to smooth earnings.\n\n8. **Unusual Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The '現金及び現金同等物' (cash and cash equivalents) has nearly doubled from 1,551,731,000 to 3,070,271,000. While this could be due to improved cash flow, the magnitude of the increase is unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above non-numerical inconsistencies and logical red flags suggest the possibility of fraudulent activities or at least the need for further scrutiny."}

However, there are several logical and contextual red flags that could suggest potential issues: \n\n1. **Significant Increase in Employee Count**: The number of employees increased from 314 to 459 in the current year, despite the company continuing to report significant losses. This is unusual as companies typically do not expand their workforce significantly during periods of financial distress. \n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow turned positive (469,541,000 yen) in the current year after being negative in prior years, despite the company still reporting significant losses. This could indicate potential manipulation of cash flow figures or one-time adjustments that are not clearly explained. \n\n3. **Large Increase in Intangible Fixed Assets**: The value of intangible fixed assets increased significantly from 1,160,584,000 yen to 2,198,894,000 yen. This is unusual for a company in financial distress and warrants further investigation into the nature of these assets and their valuation. \n\n4. **Discrepancy in Non-Controlling Interests**: The non-controlling interests (非支配株主持分) were reported as 38,908,000 yen in the prior year but are missing (－) in the current year. This is unusual and should be clarified, as it could indicate changes in ownership structure or errors in reporting. \n\n5. **Unexplained Special Losses**: The company reported a significant special loss (特別損失合計) of 224,383,000 yen in the current year, which includes impairment losses (減損損失) of 200,383,000 yen. The nature of these losses is not explained, raising questions about asset valuation and management decisions. \n\n6. **Negative Retained Earnings**: The retained earnings (利益剰余金) continue to deteriorate, reaching -3,060,060,000 yen. While this is not fraudulent in itself, it highlights the company's ongoing financial struggles and raises concerns about its ability to continue as a going concern. \n\n7. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The corporate tax adjustment (法人税等調整額) is significantly negative (-223,295,000 yen) in the current year, which is unusual and should be explained in detail. \n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they raise enough red flags to warrant further investigation into the company's financial practices and disclosures."}

This lack of historical context makes it difficult to assess trends and raises questions about the company's transparency.\n\n2. **Consistent Losses Despite Revenue Growth**: The company shows a significant increase in revenue from the prior year (from 3.37 billion yen to 4.59 billion yen), but its net losses and operating losses have not improved. This could indicate inefficiencies or potential mismanagement, though it is not definitive proof of fraud.\n\n3. **Declining Equity and Cash Reserves**: The company's equity (純資産額) has decreased from 3.4 billion yen to 2.87 billion yen, and its cash reserves (現金及び現金同等物) have also declined. This is concerning, especially when paired with consistent losses and increased liabilities.\n\n4. **Unusual Changes in Certain Accounts**: There are significant changes in accounts such as '前払費用' (Prepaid Expenses) and '投資有価証券' (Investment Securities), which have increased substantially. While this could be legitimate, it warrants further investigation to ensure these changes are not being used to manipulate financial results.\n\n5. **High Financial Activity**: The company has a high level of financial activity, including significant borrowing and repayment of long-term debt. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it could indicate financial stress or an attempt to manage cash flow artificially.\n\n6. **Negative Operating Cash Flow**: The company has negative operating cash flow for both years, which is concerning as it suggests the company is not generating enough cash from its core operations to sustain itself.\n\n7. **Absence of Key Metrics**: Metrics such as '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) and '自己資本利益率' (Return on Equity) are missing, which are typically included in securities reports.

Firstly, there is a complete lack of historical data for all prior years across all financial metrics, which is highly unusual for a company filing a securities report. This absence of historical data makes it impossible to assess trends or verify the consistency of the company's financial performance over time. Secondly, the company reported a significant net loss (-696,188,000 yen) and negative cash flows from operating and investing activities, yet it shows a substantial increase in cash and cash equivalents (1,352,765,000 yen). This discrepancy raises questions about the source of the cash inflow, which is primarily attributed to financing activities (2,668,039,000 yen). However, the financing cash flow includes a large amount of long-term borrowing (510,000,000 yen), which may not fully explain the increase in cash. Thirdly, the company's equity structure shows a negative retained earnings balance (-1,711,645,000 yen), which is inconsistent with the reported increase in net assets. Lastly, the report lacks key financial ratios and metrics, such as return on equity (ROE) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which are typically included in securities reports to provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial health.

This is unusual for a company in financial distress and could indicate misreporting or an attempt to inflate operational capacity.\n\n2. **Unusual Cash Flow Trends**: The operating cash flow turned positive in the current year (469,541,000 yen) after being negative in prior years, while the company still reported a net loss. This sudden improvement in operating cash flow, without a corresponding improvement in profitability, warrants further scrutiny.\n\n3. **Discrepancy in Non-Controlling Interests**: The non-controlling interests (非支配株主持分) were reported as 38,908,000 yen in the prior year but are missing (－) in the current year.

This large adjustment, especially in a loss-making company, could indicate aggressive tax planning or errors in tax reporting.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: Several fields, such as potential diluted earnings per share (潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益) and key management indicators (自己資本利益率、経営指標等), are missing (－). While this may be due to parsing errors, the lack of data in critical areas could indicate an attempt to obscure unfavorable information.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Financial Strategy**: The company has increased its long-term borrowings significantly (from 763,500,000 yen to 1,114,924,000 yen) while its financial cash flow has decreased.

Firstly, there is a significant and sudden decline in profitability metrics such as '税引前利益', '当期包括利益', and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' in the current year, all turning negative after consistent positive values in prior years. While this could be due to genuine operational challenges, the magnitude of the decline is unusual and should be explained in the report. Secondly, the number of employees ('従業員数') has increased significantly from 259 to 361 in the current year, despite the company reporting a substantial loss. This is counterintuitive as companies typically reduce headcount during financial distress. Thirdly, the '無形固定資産' has dropped drastically from 1,793,543,000 to 433,091,000, which could indicate asset write-offs or impairments, but the report does not provide any context or explanation for this change. Fourthly, the cash flow statement shows a positive '投資キャッシュフロー' of 1,951,525,000 in the current year, which is unusual given the company's financial losses and declining cash reserves. This could suggest asset sales or other non-operational activities that need further clarification. Lastly, the '利益剰余金' has dropped significantly from 10,148,506,000 to 3,121,219,000, which is consistent with the reported losses but still raises questions about the company's financial stability and management practices.

This is a significant jump (over 4x) without a clear explanation in the report. While the financial cash flow ('財務キャッシュフロー') shows a large inflow of 16,020,312,000 yen, the source of this inflow is not detailed, which raises questions about its legitimacy.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Non-Controlling Interests**: The '非支配株主持分' (Non-Controlling Interests) changes from a negative value (-560,000 yen) in the prior year to a positive value (15,925,000 yen) in the current year. This is an unusual shift and lacks an explanation, which could indicate manipulation or errors in reporting.\n\n3. **Significant Increase in Capital Surplus ('資本剰余金')**: The capital surplus jumps from 1,597,000,000 yen in the prior year to 9,913,135,000 yen in the current year. Such a large increase typically requires a detailed explanation, such as a major equity issuance or revaluation, which is not provided in the report.\n\n4. **Employee Count and Temporary Staff Trends**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has remained relatively stable, but the average number of temporary employees ('平均臨時雇用人員') has decreased significantly from 32 in the prior four years to just 8 in the current year. This could indicate cost-cutting measures, but the lack of a corresponding decrease in operating expenses or other explanations raises questions.\n\n5. **Unusual Asset Growth**: The total assets ('総資産') have nearly tripled from 10,432,511,000 yen in the prior year to 29,502,621,000 yen in the current year. This is an extraordinary growth rate that is not matched by a proportional increase in liabilities or a clear explanation of the source of this growth.\n\n6. **Inconsistencies in Fixed Assets Reporting**: The '車両運搬具' (Vehicles) category was not reported ('－') in the prior year but suddenly appears with a value of 26,692,000 yen in the current year. Similarly, '工具、器具及び備品' (Tools, Instruments, and Equipment) and '有形固定資産' (Tangible Fixed Assets) show significant increases without clear justification.\n\n7. **Non-Linear Profit Trends**: While the company's profits ('税引前利益' and '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') have been increasing steadily, the sudden and disproportionate growth in cash, assets, and capital surplus does not align with the historical trends, suggesting potential manipulation.\n\n8. **Unexplained Financial Cash Flow**: The financial cash flow ('財務キャッシュフロー') shows a massive inflow of 16,020,312,000 yen in the current year compared to a negligible outflow in the prior year. The lack of details about the source of this inflow (e.g., loans, equity issuance) is concerning.\n\nWhile the numerical values are consistent and verified by a CPA, the logical inconsistencies and lack of explanations for significant changes in key financial metrics raise the probability of fraudulent activities."}

Here are the key observations: \n\n1. **Significant Decline in Revenue and Profitability**: The company's revenue ('売上高') dropped drastically from 19.7 billion yen in the prior year to 4.7 billion yen in the current year, a decline of over 75%. Simultaneously, the company reported a massive loss of 7.5 billion yen ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益') compared to a small profit in the prior year. While such a decline could be due to legitimate business challenges, the scale of the drop is unusual and should be explained in detail.\n\n2. **Mismatch in Cost of Sales and Revenue**: The cost of sales ('売上原価') in the current year is 11.1 billion yen, which is more than double the revenue of 4.7 billion yen. This results in a gross loss ('売上総利益又は売上総損失（△)') of 6.3 billion yen. Such a mismatch suggests either significant inefficiencies or potential misreporting.\n\n3. **Unusual Increase in Borrowings**: The company reported a significant increase in short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') from zero in the prior year to 7.06 billion yen in the current year. This sudden increase in debt, coupled with the company's poor financial performance, raises questions about the company's liquidity and solvency.\n\n4. **Reduction in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') dropped from 466 in the prior year to 405 in the current year, while the average temporary staff ('平均臨時雇用人員') dropped drastically from 523 to 196. Such a sharp reduction in workforce could indicate financial distress or operational downsizing, but it should be consistent with other financial data and explained in the report.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Cash Flows**: The operating cash flow ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') turned negative at -6.7 billion yen, while the financing cash flow ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') increased significantly to 7.3 billion yen. This suggests the company is heavily relying on external financing to cover its operational losses, which is unsustainable in the long term.\n\n6. **Significant Decline in Equity**: The company's net assets ('純資産額') dropped from 14.4 billion yen in the prior year to 6.6 billion yen in the current year, a decline of over 50%. This is consistent with the reported losses but raises concerns about the company's financial stability.\n\n7. **Unusual Changes in Inventory and Payables**: The inventory ('原材料及び貯蔵品') decreased significantly, and accounts payable ('買掛金') also dropped sharply. These changes could indicate operational issues or potential manipulation to improve cash flow.\n\n8. **Self-Share Acquisition**: The company reported an acquisition of treasury shares ('自己株式の取得による支出') amounting to 85 million yen despite its financial struggles. This is unusual and raises questions about the company's priorities.\n\nWhile the report has been verified by a certified public accountant and the numerical values are consistent, the above points highlight several logical inconsistencies and unusual trends that could indicate potential fraud or at least require further clarification from the company."}

This is a substantial jump and is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in tangible or intangible fixed assets. The '無形固定資産' (Intangible Fixed Assets) and '有形固定資産' (Tangible Fixed Assets) both decreased in value, which raises questions about where the investment cash outflows were directed.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash Balances**: The '現金及び現金同等物' (Cash and Cash Equivalents) in the balance sheet ('bs') and cash flow statement ('cf') do not align perfectly. For example, the '現金及び現金同等物' in the balance sheet for the current year is 1,412,497,000, while the cash flow statement shows a decrease of -652,871,000 from the prior year's 2,065,368,000, which would result in a different ending balance. This inconsistency could indicate a reporting error or potential manipulation.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in '自己株式' (Treasury Stock)**: The '自己株式' (Treasury Stock) increased significantly from -99,554,000 to -199,545,000, indicating a large repurchase of shares. While this is not inherently fraudulent, it is worth investigating whether this repurchase aligns with the company's stated strategy and whether it was properly disclosed to shareholders.\n\n4. **Reduction in Intangible Fixed Assets**: The '無形固定資産' (Intangible Fixed Assets) decreased significantly from 671,544,000 to 581,279,000, despite the large investment cash outflows. This could indicate asset write-offs or impairments that are not clearly explained in the report.\n\n5. **Unexplained '減損損失' (Impairment Loss)**: The current year includes a '減損損失' (Impairment Loss) of 154,867,000, which was not present in the prior year. This should be accompanied by a detailed explanation, as it could indicate issues with asset valuation.\n\n6. **High '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)**: The '株価収益率' (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) has decreased over the years but remains relatively high at 26.8. While not directly indicative of fraud, it suggests that the company's stock may be overvalued, which could incentivize management to manipulate earnings.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: Several fields are marked as '－' (missing), particularly for the 'Prior4Year'.

While this could be due to external factors, the report does not provide sufficient qualitative explanations for this decline.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Discrepancies**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from operating activities) has increased slightly, but '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a significant outflow, and '財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from financing activities) has turned negative. This could indicate potential mismanagement of cash or aggressive investment strategies without clear justification.\n\n3. **Unusual Changes in Accounts**: The '売掛金' (accounts receivable) has decreased significantly, which could indicate aggressive collection practices or potential write-offs. Additionally, '建設仮勘定' (construction in progress) has increased substantially, which might suggest capital expenditure projects, but the report does not provide details on these projects.\n\n4. **Decline in Employee Numbers**: The number of employees ('従業員数') has been decreasing over the years, which could indicate cost-cutting measures.

This is counterintuitive unless there has been a significant increase in the number of shares outstanding, which is not mentioned in the report.\n\n2. **Negative Operating Cash Flow**: The company has reported significantly negative operating cash flows ('営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') for both years, with a worsening trend (from -1.06 billion yen to -4.44 billion yen). This is concerning, especially when paired with increasing revenue and net income, as it suggests a potential disconnect between reported profits and actual cash generation.\n\n3. **Unusual Financing Activities**: The company has a massive increase in financing cash flows ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') from 162 million yen to 5.26 billion yen. This is primarily driven by a significant increase in long-term borrowings ('長期借入れによる収入'). While this could be legitimate, the reliance on debt to cover cash flow shortfalls raises questions about the sustainability of operations.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Asset Composition**: The company's total assets ('総資産額') have increased significantly, but the breakdown of assets shows a decline in fixed assets ('固定資産') and investment securities ('投資有価証券'). This shift in asset composition is not explained and could indicate potential misclassification or overstatement of other asset categories.\n\n5. **Unusual Changes in Exchange Adjustments**: The '為替換算調整勘定' (foreign currency translation adjustments) has shifted from a negative 305.63 million yen to a positive 57.55 million yen. While this could be due to exchange rate fluctuations, the magnitude of the change is unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\n6. **Non-Disclosure of Key Details**: The report lacks details on certain critical items, such as the number of shares outstanding, which makes it difficult to fully reconcile the per-share metrics.

This discrepancy suggests that the increase in cash is not supported by core business operations. Additionally, the financing cash flow ('財務活動によるキャッシュ・フロー') shows a massive inflow of 7,811,667,000 yen in the current year, which is a stark contrast to the outflow of -635,391,000 yen in the prior year. This sudden and significant change in financing activities warrants further investigation, as it could indicate unusual or non-recurring transactions, such as undisclosed borrowings or equity injections. Furthermore, the short-term borrowings ('短期借入金') have increased dramatically from 100,000,000 yen to 5,100,000,000 yen, which could be a source of the cash inflow but raises questions about the company's liquidity management and financial health. Lastly, the company's net assets ('純資産') have more than doubled from 2,793,573,000 yen to 6,420,458,000 yen, which is inconsistent with the relatively modest increase in net income ('親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益'). This could suggest potential overstatement of assets or underreporting of liabilities. While the report has been verified by a certified public accountant, these logical inconsistencies and unusual trends suggest a higher probability of financial manipulation or fraud."}
{"edinet_code": "E39409", "doc_id": "S100VGBV", "label": 0, "prob": 0.85, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report contains several red flags that could indicate potential fraudulent activities. Firstly, there is a complete lack of historical data for all prior years across all financial metrics, which is highly unusual for a company filing a securities report. This absence of historical data makes it difficult to assess trends or validate the reported figures for the current year. Secondly, the company reports a significant increase in cash and cash equivalents (from 1,009,777,000 yen to 1,871,411,000 yen) despite a large negative cash flow from investing activities (-378,161,000 yen). This increase is primarily driven by an unusually high positive cash flow from financing activities (1,211,978,000 yen), which is not fully explained in the report. Thirdly, the company has a negative retained earnings balance (-924,382,000 yen), which is inconsistent with the reported net income for the current year (13,054,000 yen). This suggests that the company has accumulated significant losses in the past, yet no historical data is provided to verify this. Fourthly, the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is extremely high at 244.6, which is unusual and could indicate overvaluation or manipulation of earnings. Lastly, the report lacks transparency in several areas, such as the absence of detailed breakdowns for certain line items (e.g., 'その他' or 'other') and the lack of explanation for significant changes in financial metrics. While the report has been verified by a certified public accountant, these inconsistencies and omissions raise concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the reported information."}
{"edinet_code": "E38504", "doc_id": "S100TQH6", "label": 0, "prob": 0.3, "prediction": 0, "reasoning": "The financial data provided appears consistent from a numerical perspective, and there are no glaring numerical inconsistencies. However, there are a few potential red flags that warrant further investigation: \n\n1. The significant increase in '経常利益' (ordinary profit) from the prior year (886 million yen) to the current year (1.78 billion yen) is notable. While this could be due to operational improvements, the increase is disproportionate compared to the relatively modest increase in '売上高' (sales revenue). This could indicate aggressive cost-cutting, accounting adjustments, or other non-recurring factors.\n\n2. The '売上原価' (cost of sales) decreased significantly from the prior year (15.096 billion yen) to the current year (14.482 billion yen), despite an increase in sales revenue. This could suggest potential manipulation of inventory valuation or cost allocation.\n\n3. The '投資活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (cash flow from investing activities) shows a large outflow in the current year (-1.944 billion yen), which is significantly higher than the prior year (-371 million yen). This could indicate aggressive capital expenditures or potential misclassification of cash flows.\n\n4. The '自己株式' (treasury stock) shows a significant reduction in the current year (-1.161 billion yen) compared to the prior year (-2.42 billion yen). This could indicate a large buyback of shares, which might be used to artificially inflate earnings per share (EPS).\n\n5. The '減価償却累計額' (accumulated depreciation) shows a decrease from the prior year (-17.742 billion yen) to the current year (-16.841 billion yen). This is unusual, as accumulated depreciation typically increases over time unless there is a significant write-off or revaluation of assets.\n\n6. The '株価収益率' (price-to-earnings ratio) is only provided for the current year (8.3), with no data for prior years. This lack of historical data could obscure trends and make it harder to assess the company's valuation.\n\n7. The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (diluted EPS) is only provided for the current year (575.01 yen), with no data for prior years. This could indicate a lack of transparency regarding potential dilution effects in previous years.\n\nWhile these points do not definitively indicate fraud, they highlight areas that require further scrutiny, such as the reasons behind the significant profit increase, the decrease in cost of sales, and the changes in cash flow and depreciation. Additionally, the lack of historical data for certain metrics raises questions about transparency."}
{"edinet_code": "E38078", "doc_id": "S100VGEO", "label": 0, "prob": 0.7, "prediction": 1, "reasoning": "The securities report appears to be consistent in terms of numerical data and calculations. However, there are several non-numerical and logical red flags that could suggest potential fraudulent activities or at least warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **Unusual Increase in Parent Company Net Income**: The '親会社株主に帰属する当期純利益' (Net Income Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders) has more than doubled from the prior year (136,800,000 to 301,663,000). This is a significant jump that is not fully explained by the increase in revenue or other operational metrics. While the sale of investment securities (114,341,000) contributes to this increase, the magnitude of the jump still seems disproportionate.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Cash Flow Trends**: The '営業活動によるキャッシュ・フロー' (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) has increased significantly (124,453,000 to 374,699,000), which is inconsistent with the relatively modest increase in revenue and profit margins. This could indicate aggressive revenue recognition or manipulation of working capital accounts.\n\n3. **Investment Securities Transactions**: The '投資有価証券の売却による収入' (Proceeds from Sale of Investment Securities) shows a significant increase (24,696,000 to 195,779,000). This aligns with the reported '投資有価証券売却益' (Gain on Sale of Investment Securities) in the income statement. However, the reliance on one-time gains from asset sales to boost profits could be a red flag, especially if it is not part of the company's core operations.\n\n4. **Unusual Tax Adjustments**: The '法人税等調整額' (Income Tax Adjustments) has shifted from a positive adjustment (15,089,000) in the prior year to a negative adjustment (-9,964,000) in the current year. This could indicate aggressive tax planning or adjustments to inflate net income.\n\n5. **Significant Decrease in Long-Term Debt**: The '長期借入金' (Long-Term Borrowings) has decreased significantly (227,062,000 to 54,206,000). While reducing debt is generally positive, the magnitude of the decrease, combined with the increase in cash flow, raises questions about the source of funds and whether liabilities are being understated.\n\n6. **Unexplained Changes in Allowances**: The '貸倒引当金' (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) has increased (62,273,000 to 73,070,000), despite a relatively modest increase in accounts receivable. This could indicate potential issues with the quality of receivables or an attempt to manipulate earnings by adjusting allowances.\n\n7. **Lack of Disclosure on Diluted Earnings Per Share**: The '潜在株式調整後１株当たり当期純利益' (Diluted Earnings Per Share) is not disclosed ('－') for all years. While this may be due to the absence of dilutive securities, the lack of disclosure could also indicate an attempt to obscure the impact of potential dilution.\n\n8. **Significant Increase in Tax Payables**: The '未払法人税等' (Accrued Corporate Taxes) has increased dramatically (250,000 to 123,827,000). This is inconsistent with the cash flow statement, which shows a significant decrease in tax payments. This discrepancy warrants further investigation.\n\nWhile these issues do not conclusively prove fraud, they highlight areas of concern that require further scrutiny, particularly around revenue recognition, cash flow management, and one-time gains from asset sales."}
